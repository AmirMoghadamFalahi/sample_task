The crux of the problem shows up in two telling line items — the number of used vehicles retailed and the average net-profit contribution each retail sale produces.
When dealers check these numbers, and compare them to years past, the review often reaches an unsettling conclusion. Despite retailing more used vehicles, dealers are making less money.
You see this troubling trend in the dealership financial data from the National Automobile Dealers Association.
In 2011, NADA reported that the average dealer retailed 568 used vehicles and earned an average retail net profit per used vehicle retailed of $203. In 2018, the average dealer retailed 700-plus used vehicles and earned $6 in average retail net profit.
In that seven-year period, I was struck when the retail net-profit figures went negative, to -$2 in 2017.
This marked shift in the net profitability of used vehicles spurred a team of data scientists and me to take a deeper look at the used-vehicle market itself.
We analyzed inventory and transaction data across the time in question. We discovered an important development that I now believe represents a new truth of used-vehicle profitability.
The team and I discovered that in the spring of 2016, the pace of depreciation or margin compression in used vehicles took off.
Up until this time, our research showed that it took about 60 days for a vehicle in a dealer's inventory to reach a cost-to-market percentage of 90 percent or higher.
But then we found that, for a variety of factors, used vehicles in dealer inventories were reaching the 90 percent cost-to-market threshold in 30 days, and sometimes even sooner.
The primary takeaway from this finding is that, for all intents and purposes, the viable retail shelf life of most used vehicles is essentially half of what many dealers consider an appropriate amount of time to retail a vehicle.
Ever since this discovery, I've been working hard to help dealers recognize how the used-vehicle market has changed, and the steps they can take to improve their net-profit outcomes in their used-vehicle departments.
I caution dealers that the traditional ""stock up to sell"" strategy is no longer as effective given that the viable retail time frame for most used vehicles to make a meaningful net-profit contribution is now 30 days or less.
Consider: If dealers carry twice as many used vehicles as they retail in a 30-day period, some vehicles will ultimately and unfortunately end up as net losses after dealers retail the units, deduct sales commissions and allocate other expenses to the vehicles.
Instead, I encourage dealers to do two things. First, dealers should maintain their used-vehicle inventory levels in line with their rolling 30-day total of retail sales. If you've sold 75 vehicles in the last 30 days, you should have 75 vehicles in your inventory.
Second, dealers must learn to make peace with the truth about each used vehicle's net profit and investment return potential from the moment you own it.
I fully understand that neither prescription is easy.
Each represents a dose of medicine that a lot of dealers find distasteful, particularly when we've all been taught that every ""fresh"" car deserves a shot at delivering gross.
But I've also seen firsthand that the medicine works, and I believe it will be especially useful for dealers who expect their used-vehicle departments to drive higher levels of sales performance and profitability in the year ahead.

Q: What was your biggest accomplishment as chairman?
A: When I started last January, I wanted dealers to not just be a member of NADA, but to be NADA. That means getting involved, joining an NADA 20 Group or sending one of your key people to the NADA Academy for training, meeting with your elected officials, whether it's city or state or even federal, and getting involved with your OEMs and developing a relationship.
Did more dealers participate in NADA initiatives in 2019?
Our 20 Group membership — we had a record-setting year. And we actually had 540 dealer employees graduate from NADA Academy.
When an issue comes up, if we have one more person that is involved and can make a difference, whether it's with the OEM or regulators or federal or state officials, then we've succeeded. And I think we have made progress in that area.
How has NADA worked with automakers on vehicle affordability?
The affordability issue is an ongoing issue. As we put more technology, safety, autonomous features on these cars, it absolutely drives the price up.
We had over 60 meetings with the OEMs last year, and we discussed affordability of vehicles for our consumers. Our average transaction price has risen. Fortunately for us, interest rates have kind of fallen a little bit or at least stabilized. But as we talked to the OEMs, we stress putting technology on the cars that the customers want. And we have to keep entry-level vehicles in our portfolio. If we can achieve those two things, we're in good shape.
We also have to work with our regulators and encourage them to make sure that the fuel economy standards can be achieved affordably to our customers. We can't set standards that will price our customers out of the market.
How has NADA worked with dealers to ensure that their new-vehicle departments can be sustainable long term?
We've made some progress with a couple OEMs. They're taking a look at some of the complex incentives, and I think they're rolling some of those back.
We have to continue to talk to the OEMs about that and stress how important it is that a dealer can profitably sell a vehicle so we have a long-term, sustainable business model.
Are stair-step incentive programs still an issue? If so, what progress has been made?
Stair-step incentives, overly complex incentives, incentives that aren't available to every customer, every dealer or even every vehicle in the vehicle line — they destroy customer confidence in dealers and destroy our profitability. It's something that we work on all the time. We are making some progress.
There are a couple of OEMs that are taking a hard look at that and trying to simplify it. As our business stabilizes or even slightly declines, I think each OEM wants to get a little bit more of the business, and some think that stair-steps are the way to go. But it's actually damaging to the brand, and we're stressing that. I think the OEMs understand that a little bit more.
In January 2019, NADA launched a technician hiring initiative. What were the results?
Our website is up and running. We have had over 50,000 page views. That website tells prospective technicians where they can find training centers, where they can find scholarships. It provides some examples of techs and their careers and lifestyles.
We have OEMs talking about it, tech schools talking about it. Even at our auto shows, we're now stressing tech competitions. We have really opened up everybody's eyes to this issue.

We're gaining a lot of ground there, but again, it's a work in progress.
What were your top legislative initiatives in 2019?
Tariffs are right at the top. Two years ago, we weren't even talking about tariffs. Now that's the single thing you hear all the time. With the affordability issue, tariffs are a huge problem for us. We want to make sure that [the Trump administration] understood the data, the complexity of what tariffs mean to the automobile business.
We talked to the Department of Commerce, the Department of Transportation, even the White House, in making sure they understood how much damage could be done not only to dealers but to the economy. I think we've done a good job there. We came out in support of the [United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement]. And we stood to potentially lose 117,000 dealership jobs if tariffs were levied across the board. There is a lot more work to be done.
We have to get the other trade negotiations completed so we can have affordable vehicles for our consumers.
What advice would you give the incoming chairman?
Rhett Ricart is going to do a fantastic job. He has been there with me every step of the way. The advice I would give anybody is that it's all about relationships. We have to develop great relationships with our OEMs, with our federal representatives and senators, with our fellow dealers, and work together as one team. This NADA team is incredible.
The reason I can go to sleep at night is I have the comfort of knowing we have NADA behind us. Always develop great relationships, take care of those relationships and speak the truth, always do the right thing, and we'll all be fine.
In 2018, dealers on average lost money on operations for the first time in at least a decade, leaving them more dependent on automaker incentives for profits. Is profitability still a big concern?
Dealer profitability is always a major concern. But through August of [2019], dealer operating profits were up to $96,038. We made progress there.
We have stabilized the profitability issue with dealers, but I would tell everybody that with a stable market or even a slightly declining market, there is intense pressure on new-vehicle profitability.
Most dealers are really looking at parts and service and body shop operations. Used cars are going to be strong again in 2020.
There's going to be plenty of off-lease vehicles. So we have a lot of ability to grow profitability. But expense control and looking at other revenue streams is very important to dealerships.
We're smart businesspeople, and we'll adjust. I really think 2020 is going to be a good year for dealers.
What's NADA's 2020 sales forecast?
We're forecasting 16.8 million again this year. That's a good, robust industry. We're going to be fine. We just have to be good businesspeople.
As sales slow, what are dealers' biggest concerns?
All dealers are feeling the new-vehicle department profitability issue. We need to figure out how to sell vehicles and make a reasonable profit on vehicles.
The other concern is, what's my future? I think we have a tremendously bright future ahead.
When we discuss the results of our NADA Dealer Attitude Survey, one of the things we stress to [automakers] is to make sure that as they are looking into the future of mobility, they tell the dealers what the dealers' role in it is. The role of the dealer is going to be there as long as we take care of our business and take care of our customers.
To the dealer, the customer is everything, so we have to develop long-term relationships, and we have to have strategies that do that.
Letting the dealers take care of them for their service needs, having that well-trained, world-class, diverse work force is so incredibly important for dealers to sustain long term. There's not going to be a revolution in our business. It's going to be an evolution. There's going to be change, and we as dealers can and will adapt to change.
What does NADA think automakers should be doing with regard to establishing standards on data security and privacy for the dealership network?
We've formed two data subcommittees to address this issue. Data is something that dealers are going to be more and more concerned about, and we have to get our hands around it. I'm really proud that we're opening up that conversation about data.
Along with the connected car and telematics, it's more and more of an issue to dealers of, what are we going to do with this data? This data is something we need to use to take care of our customers, to make sure we can service our customers. But we also have to make sure that we can securely store it, use it, collect it and share it. We have to be efficient with our use of data. Data isn't only just between customer and dealer, but OEMs, third-party vendors, even the vehicle itself. We want to make sure that all dealers are comfortable and are knowledgeable and can comply with the laws.
It sounds like this initiative is related to the California Consumer Privacy Act and some of the other state regulations.
That's right. I'm sure at some point we're going to have to be talking to the federal government about this also.
It's something that I think we're on the forefront of. We need to make sure that we're prepared for this.","During Charlie Gilchrist tenure as 2019 chairman of the National Automobile Dealers Association, Charlie Gilchrist brought conversations about vehicle affordability, the technician shortage and dealer involvement in NADA to the forefront. Charlie Gilchrist counts pushing those three issues among Charlie Gilchrist greatest accomplishments while at the helm.
Charlie Gilchrist sees a healthy 2020 for dealers, as long as dealers tap into multiple revenue streams and strengthen relationships with customers and automakers.
Gilchrist, 64, is president of Gilchrist Automotive, which sells 10 brands at nine dealerships in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Charlie Gilchrist spoke with Staff Reporter Hannah Lutz about auto sales, affordability concerns, the tariff threat and the need for technicians at dealerships. Here are edited excerpts.
Q: What was your biggest accomplishment as chairman?
A: When I started last January, I wanted dealers to not just be a member of NADA, but to be NADA. That means getting involved, joining an NADA 20 Group or sending one of your key people to the NADA Academy for training, meeting with your elected officials, whether it's city or state or even federal, and getting involved with your OEMs and developing a relationship.
Did more dealers participate in the NADA Academy initiatives in 2019?
Our 20 Group membership — Our had a record-setting year. And Our actually had 540 dealer employees graduate from the NADA Academy.
When an issue comes up, if we have one more person that is involved and can make a difference, whether it's with the OEM or regulators or federal or state officials, then we've succeeded. And I think we have made progress in that area.
How has the NADA Academy worked with automakers on vehicle affordability?
The affordability issue is an ongoing issue. As we put more technology, safety, autonomous features on these cars, The affordability issue absolutely drives the price up.
we had over 60 meetings with the OEMs last year, and we discussed affordability of vehicles for we consumers. we average transaction price has risen. Fortunately for us, interest rates have kind of fallen a little bit or at least stabilized. But as we talked to the OEMs, we stress putting technology on the cars that the customers want. And we have to keep entry-level vehicles in we portfolio. If we can achieve those two things, we're in good shape.
we also have to work with we regulators and encourage our regulators to make sure that the fuel economy standards can be achieved affordably to we customers. we can't set standards that will price we customers out of the market.
How has NADA worked with dealers to ensure that dealers new-vehicle departments can be sustainable long term?
we've made some progress with a couple OEMs. a couple OEMs're taking a look at some of the complex incentives, and I think a couple OEMs're rolling some of those back.
we have to continue to talk to a couple OEMs about that and stress how important it is that a dealer can profitably sell a vehicle so we have a long-term, sustainable business model.
Are stair-step incentive programs still an issue? If so, what progress has been made?
Stair-step incentives, overly complex incentives, incentives that aren't available to every customer, every dealer or even every vehicle in the vehicle line — they destroy customer confidence in dealers and destroy we profitability. It's something that we work on all the time. we are making some progress.
There are a couple of OEMs that are taking a hard look at that and trying to simplify it. As we business stabilizes or even slightly declines, I think each OEM wants to get a little bit more of our business, and some think that stair-steps are the way to go. But it's actually damaging to the brand, and we're stressing that. I think the OEMs understand that a little bit more.
In January 2019, NADA launched a technician hiring initiative. What were the results?
we website is up and running. we have had over 50,000 page views. Our website tells prospective technicians where they can find training centers, where they can find scholarships. Our website provides some examples of techs and techs careers and lifestyles.
we have OEMs talking about Our website, tech schools talking about Our website. Even at we auto shows, we're now stressing tech competitions. we have really opened up everybody's eyes to this issue. It is something so critical to we because we future really depends on we ability to recruit and train and then keep these techs long term. Based on we numbers, we're going to be short almost 40,000 techs each year. we have to have the ability to bring techs into we fold, get techs trained and get techs to the dealership. we're gaining a lot of ground there, but again, it's a work in progress.
What were your top legislative initiatives in 2019?
Tariffs are right at the top. Two years ago, we weren't even talking about Tariffs. Now that's the single thing you hear all the time. With the affordability issue, tariffs are a huge problem for us. us want to make sure that [the Trump administration] understood the data, the complexity of what tariffs mean to the automobile business.
us talked to the Department of Commerce, the Department of Transportation, even the White House, in making sure the Department of Commerce, the Department of Transportation, even the White House understood how much damage could be done not only to dealers but to the economy. I think us've done a good job there. us came out in support of the [United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement]. And us stood to potentially lose 117,000 dealership jobs if tariffs were levied across the board. There is a lot more work to be done.
us have to get the other trade negotiations completed so us can have affordable vehicles for us consumers.
What advice would you give the incoming chairman?
Rhett Ricart is going to do a fantastic job. Rhett Ricart has been there with me every step of the way. The advice I would give anybody is that it's all about relationships. us have to develop great relationships with us OEMs, with us federal representatives and senators, with us fellow dealers, and work together as one team. one team is incredible.
The reason I can go to sleep at night is I have the comfort of knowing us have NADA behind us. Always develop great relationships, take care of those relationships and speak the truth, always do the right thing, and we'll all be fine.
In 2018, dealers on average lost money on operations for the first time in at least a decade, leaving dealers on average lost money on operations for the first time in at least a decade more dependent on automaker incentives for profits. Is profitability still a big concern?
Dealer profitability is always a major concern. But through August of [2019], dealer operating profits were up to $96,038. we made progress there.
we have stabilized the profitability issue with dealers, but I would tell everybody that with a stable market or even a slightly declining market, there is intense pressure on new-vehicle profitability.
Most dealers are really looking at parts and service and body shop operations. Used cars are going to be strong again in 2020.
There's going to be plenty of off-lease vehicles. So we have a lot of ability to grow profitability. But expense control and looking at other revenue streams is very important to dealerships.
we're smart businesspeople, and we'll adjust. I really think 2020 is going to be a good year for dealers.
What's NADA's 2020 sales forecast?
We're forecasting 16.8 million again this year. That's a good, robust industry. We're going to be fine. We just have to be good businesspeople.
As sales slow, what are dealers' biggest concerns?
All dealers are feeling the new-vehicle department profitability issue. We need to figure out how to sell vehicles and make a reasonable profit on vehicles.
The other concern is, what's my future? I think We have a tremendously bright future ahead.
When We discuss the results of We NADA Dealer Attitude Survey, one of the things We stress to [automakers] is to make sure that as [automakers are looking into the future of mobility, [automakers tell All dealers what All dealers role in it is. The role of the dealer is going to be there as long as we take care of we business and take care of we customers.
To the dealer, the customer is everything, so we have to develop long-term relationships, and we have to have strategies that do that.
Letting All dealers take care of All dealers for All dealers service needs, having that well-trained, world-class, diverse work force is so incredibly important for dealers to sustain long term. There's not going to be a revolution in we business. It's going to be an evolution. There's going to be change, and we as dealers can and will adapt to change.
What does the NADA Academy think automakers should be doing with regard to establishing standards on data security and privacy for the dealership network?
we've formed two data subcommittees to address this issue. Data is something that dealers are going to be more and more concerned about, and we have to get we hands around it. I'm really proud that we're opening up that conversation about data.
Along with the connected car and telematics, it's more and more of an issue to dealers of, what are we going to do with this data? this data is something we need to use to take care of we customers, to make sure we can service we customers. But we also have to make sure that we can securely store it, use it, collect it and share it. we have to be efficient with we use of data. Data isn't only just between customer and dealer, but OEMs, third-party vendors, even the vehicle itself. we want to make sure that all dealers are comfortable and are knowledgeable and can comply with the laws.
It sounds like this initiative is related to the California Consumer Privacy Act and some of the other state regulations.
That's right. I'm sure at some point we're going to have to be talking to the federal government about this also.
It's something that I think we're on the forefront of. we need to make sure that we're prepared for this."

He examines the point cloud produced on the screen by his company's latest product, Hydra, which combines sensing, software and computing into a single platform tailor-made for exactly these sorts of highway environments.
The technology underpinning Hydra allows automated systems to detect and classify objects out to a distance of 250 meters, and the software is optimized for highway environments. It's targeted at companies seeking to enable driver-assist features or highway pilots involving Level 3 and 4 systems.
With a realization throughout the industry that more comprehensive applications of autonomy remain far off, Russell says applications geared toward niche environments such as highways are a way to meet today's market demands.
""That's the only way to get real cars on real roads in a near-term time frame, as opposed to this being a decade-plus problem,"" he said.
Hydra, which ships to customers this quarter, was among a number of notable lidar-related unveilings at CES this month.
Among the others: Ouster showcased its OS0, a lidar sensor with a 90-degree field of view. The company says the technology was developed in collaboration with automaker and Tier 1 clients. It's comparable to the Laser Bear Honeycomb lidar that Waymo developed in-house, and it allows customers to customize and configure beam spacing.
Elsewhere around CES, Velodyne introduced a new CEO and a new product — the Velabit, a $100 lidar sensor the company says can detect objects at a range of 100 meters and easily integrate into a variety of driver-assist and AV applications.
While each is tailored for different environments and applications, what might be remembered most from CES may not be products, but a shift in business model.
Luminar says it's shying away from selling sensors and instead will sell subscriptions to its lidar services.
Russell says it's a ""natural progression"" that better reflects the ongoing software development that Luminar does to improve features with customers as they become available.
Jeffrey Hannah, director of North America for technology research company SBD Automotive, says the new subscription model is a ""reflection of an increasingly brutal lidar space,"" where ""market players are seeking any type of differentiation.""
Luminar has developed one additional feature with Hydra that might differentiate it from competitors that also make amplitude-modulated lidar: The technology can now determine the three-dimensional velocity of those targets.
Gathering velocity information from lidar traditionally was an arduous engineering challenge — and one that only companies working on frequency-modulated, continuous-wave approaches have achieved.
Doing so with amplitude-modulated lidars, such as the ones Luminar makes, is something of a breakthrough. Russell says the company cracked the velocity conundrum with a special scanning pattern that measures how the distance from an object has changed between pulses, and it gives automakers a new trove of information.

Luminar says Luminar's shying away from selling sensors and instead will sell subscriptions to Luminar lidar services.
Russell says it's a ""natural progression"" that better reflects the ongoing software development that Luminar does to improve features with customers as customers become available.
Jeffrey Hannah, director of North America for technology research company SBD Automotive, says the new subscription model is a ""reflection of an increasingly brutal lidar space,"" where ""market players are seeking any type of differentiation.""
Luminar has developed one additional feature with Hydra that might differentiate Luminar from competitors that also make amplitude-modulated lidar: The technology can now determine the three-dimensional velocity of those targets.
Gathering velocity information from lidar traditionally was an arduous engineering challenge — and one that only companies working on frequency-modulated, continuous-wave approaches have achieved.
Doing so with amplitude-modulated lidars, such as the ones Luminar makes, is something of a breakthrough. Russell says Luminar cracked the velocity conundrum with a special scanning pattern that measures how the distance from an object has changed between pulses, and Luminar gives automakers a new trove of information.
""It's a pretty cool functionality,"" Russell said. ""And Luminar're getting It without trade-offs on performance and cost. It's pretty crazy."""

Ghosn's personal life has been turned upside down, with restrictions placed on his movements and even his access to his wife and family. His ordeal continues to unfold. The following is a chronology of the past year's events.
Ghosn is arrested and jailed after landing in Nissan's corporate jet at Tokyo's Haneda international airport. At a late-night news conference in Japan, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa blasts his former mentor as the ""mastermind"" of widespread financial misconduct during his time at the helm of Nissan and says the board is preparing to dismiss him as chairman.
Ghosn is held in the Tokyo Detention House, a spartan facility that also houses death-row inmates from the Japanese cult that perpetrated the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin attack.
At the same time, Nissan senior executive Greg Kelly, an American from Nashville and a close Ghosn associate, is arrested in Tokyo and jailed on the accusation that he is a conspirator.
Japanese media reports begin to swirl with allegations that Nissan paid large amounts for Ghosn residences around the world, including pads with questionable business connections in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam.
The Japanese and French governments express support for a stable Renault-Nissan alliance. But Japanese media report that Nissan executives want to leverage the crisis as an opportunity to weaken the French company's influence over its larger Japanese partner. Speculation quickly percolates about Ghosn's arrest being part of a corporate coup to wrest more independence for Nissan.
Ghosn, still in jail, is fired by Nissan's board.

Alliance partner Mitsubishi dismisses Ghosn as chairman.
The Ghosn affair enters the diplomatic sphere as French President Emmanuel Macron petitions Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for a sit-down to discuss the matter at a Group of 20 summit. Macron is seen as a driving force behind moves to bind the two companies in an irreversible partnership, a push viewed suspiciously in Japan. Abe signals concern about France's intent and tells Macron the alliance should not be fiddled with, according to reports.
Conspiracy theories gain further currency amid unsubstantiated reports that the day Ghosn was arrested at the airport, he had been en route with Kelly to remove Saikawa as CEO.
Ghosn and Nissan itself are indicted over failure to report, for the 2010-14 fiscal years, more than $40 million in deferred compensation owed to Ghosn after his retirement. Japanese prosecutors say omitting the information in the company's filings violates the country's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. The same day, Ghosn is rearrested on suspicion of doing the same, underreporting some $40 million, for the 2015-17 fiscal years.
Nissan shares with Renault a dossier of allegations against Ghosn, amid mounting distrust between the partners, questions about evidence and French skepticism over the charges.
Nissan begins efforts to seize keys and change locks on Ghosn's company-paid homes around the world while blocking access to the properties by Ghosn's representatives and family members, Bloomberg reports.
Ghosn, while still in jail, is arrested on a new charge of breach of trust over allegations of temporarily transferring some $17 million in personal investment losses on swap contracts to Nissan during the global financial crisis, and then having Nissan pay $14.7 million to a Ghosn business associate from 2009 to 2012 for helping Ghosn manage the losses.
Kelly is granted bail. He is released from jail the following day.
Ghosn appears in public for the first time since his November arrest, going before the Tokyo District Court in handcuffs and plastic slippers to deny the allegations against him and assert that he has been ""wrongly accused and unfairly detained."" After nearly two months in jail, the usually immaculately coiffed businessman looks thinner than usual, courtesy of his rice-heavy diet in detention.
Ghosn is officially indicted on the breach-of-trust charge from his Dec. 21 arrest and on the charge stemming from his Dec. 10 arrest that he failed to report deferred income for the 2015-17 fiscal years.
Nissan and Mitsubishi accuse Ghosn of pocketing about $8.6 million in improper compensation from a Netherlands subsidiary they jointly own, called Nissan-Mitsubishi, or NMBV. The company was established to reward employees at both companies who find synergies by giving them a share of the savings. But Nissan and Mitsubishi claim that Ghosn used the entity to authorize large payouts to himself.
Ghosn resigns as chairman and CEO of Renault. His lieutenant at the company, Thierry Bollore, is appointed CEO, while Jean-Dominique Senard, then-CEO of tire maker Michelin, is brought in as chairman.
Media report that Macron tells Abe he is worried about Ghosn's conditions in jail, criticizing the detention as ""too long and too hard.""
In his first media interview since his November arrest, Ghosn tells Japan's Nikkei business daily that he is the victim of ""plot and treason."" He says forces inside Nissan framed him to prevent his plan to further integrate Nissan and Mitsubishi with Renault. The plan was to fold the carmakers under a holding company, he says, adding that he discussed the strategy with Saikawa in September.
Still in jail after nearly three months, Ghosn fires his first lawyer, a former public prosecutor, and hires Junichiro Hironaka. The high-profile defense attorney is nicknamed ""The Razor"" for his combative approach and his success at cutting to the core of cases and winning his clients' freedom.
Renault scraps $33 million in deferred and severance pay for Ghosn. Reuters reports that such a golden parachute is politically problematic in France, where Macron's government is under siege by ""yellow vest"" street protests against social inequality.
Ghosn is granted bail at $9.2 million, an amount he pays in cash.
Ghosn walks to freedom after 108 days in the Tokyo Detention House. He attempts to evade paparazzi by disguising himself as a workman leaving the jail grounds in a commercial minivehicle, but he is quickly recognized, and a media circus envelops Tokyo as news helicopters and media motorbikes tail him through the capital's streets for live coverage.
Relations among the alliance partner companies have strained over the Ghosn affair. In an effort to soothe matters, the heads of Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi meet in Yokohama, Japan, to announce a new power-sharing agreement that charts a ""new start"" for the auto alliance.
Ghosn takes to Twitter, opening an account and writing in his first post that he will ""tell the truth about what's happening"" at an April 11 news conference, amid reports that Japanese prosecutors may level fresh charges against him.
In an early-morning raid on his Tokyo apartment, Ghosn is arrested for a fourth time, on allegations of financial misconduct, in a move that escalates the legal jeopardy facing the ousted auto executive as he awaits trial in Tokyo. Prosecutors charge him with breach of trust, saying he caused financial damage to Nissan by misappropriating some $5 million for personal use. Their filing alleges Ghosn arranged to have about $15 million transferred from a wholly owned Nissan subsidiary to a bank of an overseas sales representative from December 2015 through July 2018. Ghosn is sent back to the Tokyo Detention House.
At an extraordinary meeting, angry shareholders blame Saikawa and the current management for allowing Ghosn's alleged misdeeds to happen in the first place.
Ghosn releases a video statement recorded before his latest arrest, speaking out about the charges against him and bashing Nissan's current management for driving business into reverse and then ""selfishly"" protecting their own jobs by instigating a ""backstabbing"" coup to remove him from office. Without naming individuals, a calm and collected Ghosn says their own fear of losing control — as Nissan marched toward a merger with Renault — spurred them to hatch a plot against him.
""This is not about greed. This is not about dictatorship. This is about a plot. This is about conspiracy. This is about backstabbing,"" Ghosn says. ""There was first a fear that the next step of the alliance, in terms of convergence and in terms of moving toward a merger, would, in a certain way, threaten some people or eventually threaten the autonomy of Nissan.""
Japanese prosecutors indict Ghosn for a fourth time, on the breach-of-trust charges stemming from his April 4 arrest that he misappropriated $5 million by siphoning money through a third company ""virtually owned by him.""
Ghosn leaves jail for a second time, after 21 days, on $4.6 million bail. More stringent bail conditions are applied that prohibit Ghosn from having contact with his wife, Carole Ghosn.
In a bombshell development, Renault and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles confirm they are in talks for a 50-50 merger. The move blindsides Nissan, which was left out of the discussions. Nissan withholds initial support for the idea, rattling the resolve of the French government, Renault's biggest shareholder. FCA withdraws the merger proposal June 6, blaming ""political conditions"" in France.
Nissan shareholders approve sweeping reforms to improve corporate governance at the company's annual shareholders meeting. Renault's Senard, in attendance as the newly appointed vice chairman of Nissan, pleads with skeptical shareholders to believe he has the automaker's best interests at heart.
Ghosn representatives hastily call a late-night press conference that would be his first opportunity to speak publicly in person. The plan is scrubbed just hours ahead of time, with people close to Ghosn saying there was fear of retaliation from prosecutors.
Saikawa is forced to resign, effective Sept. 16, following revelations he misused an executive incentive program, throwing the automaker into further turmoil.
Ghosn agrees to pay $1 million to settle, without admitting guilt, a separate U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission complaint that he hid some $140 million in future payouts over nearly a decade. Kelly, the former Nissan director accused of conspiring with Ghosn, agrees to a $100,000 penalty in a similar settlement. Nissan as a corporate entity agrees to pay $15 million.
Renault's board removes Bollore, a longtime Ghosn protege, as CEO and names CFO Clotilde Delbos as interim chief executive. Bollore reportedly had icy relations with Nissan management, and the shuffle is seen as an attempt by Senard to patch up relations.
In a long-shot gambit, Ghosn's lawyers petition the court to dismiss the charges against him, arguing that prosecutors violated Ghosn's rights by engaging in such activities as illegal evidence collection and conspiring with Nissan to frame him. As of last week, the court had not replied, but it did reject an appeal to loosen Ghosn's bail restrictions so he might contact his wife. His lawyers say they do not expect his trial to begin until April at the earliest.","One year ago this week, Carlos Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo and immediately taken to jail on suspicion of financial misdeeds that were not immediately made clear. At that moment, Carlos Ghosn was chairman of Nissan Motor Co.; chairman of Mitsubishi Motors Corp.; chairman and CEO of Renault; and CEO of Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, the loosely structured alliance of the three automakers. One year later, Carlos Ghosn holds none of those roles. Carlos Ghosn has been charged with multiple counts of impropriety in Japan but convicted of none of multiple counts of impropriety in Japan as Carlos Ghosn awaits trial. Ghosn's personal life has been turned upside down, with restrictions placed on Carlos Ghosn movements and even Carlos Ghosn access to Carlos Ghosn wife and family. Carlos Ghosn ordeal continues to unfold. The following is a chronology of the past year's events.
Carlos Ghosn is arrested and jailed after landing in Nissan's corporate jet at Tokyo's Haneda international airport. At a late-night news conference in Japan, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa blasts Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa former mentor as the ""mastermind"" of widespread financial misconduct during Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa time at the helm of Nissan and says Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa is preparing to dismiss Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa as chairman.
Carlos Ghosn is held in the Tokyo Detention House, a spartan facility that also houses death-row inmates from the Japanese cult that perpetrated the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin attack.
At the same time, Nissan senior executive Greg Kelly, an American from Nashville and a close Carlos Ghosn associate, is arrested in Tokyo and jailed on the accusation that Carlos Ghosn is a conspirator.
Japanese media reports begin to swirl with allegations that Nissan paid large amounts for Carlos Ghosn residences around the world, including pads with questionable business connections in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam.
The Japanese and French governments express support for Renault —. But Japanese media report that Nissan executives want to leverage the crisis as an opportunity to weaken the French company's influence over the French company larger Japanese partner. Speculation quickly percolates about Carlos Ghosn's arrest being part of a corporate coup to wrest more independence for Nissan.
Carlos Ghosn, still in jail, is fired by Nissan's board.

Alliance partner Mitsubishi dismisses Ghosn as chairman.
The Ghosn affair enters the diplomatic sphere as French President Emmanuel Macron petitions Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for a sit-down to discuss the matter at a Group of 20 summit. Macron is seen as a driving force behind moves to bind the two companies in an irreversible partnership, a push viewed suspiciously in Japan. Abe signals concern about France's intent and tells Macron the alliance should not be fiddled with, according to reports.
Conspiracy theories gain further currency amid unsubstantiated reports that the day Ghosn was arrested at the airport, Ghosn had been en route with Kelly to remove Saikawa as CEO.
Ghosn and Nissan are indicted over failure to report, for the 2010-14 fiscal years, more than $40 million in deferred compensation owed to Ghosn after Ghosn retirement. Japanese prosecutors say omitting the information in the company's filings violates the country's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. the day, Ghosn is rearrested on suspicion of doing the same, underreporting some $40 million, for the 2015-17 fiscal years.
Nissan shares with Renault a dossier of allegations against Ghosn, amid mounting distrust between the partners, questions about evidence and French skepticism over the charges.
Nissan begins efforts to seize keys and change locks on Ghosn's company-paid homes around the world while blocking access to the properties by Ghosn's representatives and family members, Bloomberg reports.
Ghosn, while still in jail, is arrested on a new charge of breach of trust over allegations of temporarily transferring some $17 million in personal investment losses on swap contracts to Nissan during the global financial crisis, and then having Nissan pay $14.7 million to a Ghosn business associate from 2009 to 2012 for helping Ghosn manage the losses.
Kelly is granted bail. Kelly is released from jail the following day.
Ghosn appears in public for the first time since Ghosn November arrest, going before the Tokyo District Court in handcuffs and plastic slippers to deny the allegations against Ghosn and assert that Ghosn has been ""wrongly accused and unfairly detained."" After nearly two months in jail, Ghosn looks thinner than usual, courtesy of Ghosn rice-heavy diet in detention.
Ghosn is officially indicted on the breach-of-trust charge from Ghosn Dec. 21 arrest and on the charge stemming from Ghosn Dec. 10 arrest that Ghosn failed to report deferred income for the 2015-17 fiscal years.

Teleoperation enables a human operator to control vehicles from far away. In July, Florida became the sixth state to explicitly allow autonomous vehicle companies to use remote operators. The legislation means that the next time you're driving down a Florida road, there's a chance the car behind you won't have a driver in it. At all.
A number of states and countries have either legalized teleoperation or mandated it. Outside the U.S., laws mandating teleoperation exist in Ontario, Japan, Finland, the Netherlands and England.

This sentiment was echoed in industry-leader statements such as that of Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Hackett in April at the Detroit Economic Club: ""We overestimated the arrival of autonomous vehicles.""
Meanwhile, the AV industry continues to make progress. It is set to deploy new models with technology that will still require a human to negotiate edge cases. It is now also becoming clear that the safety-driver requirement that may have worked well for the initial testing phase is no longer relevant, especially for any commercial deployment.
This is what makes the Florida legislation so relevant. Now that both legislators and the AV industry understand that full autonomy isn't as imminent as once thought, we need to find alternative solutions. That's where teleoperation comes in.
When the AV encounters an edge case it cannot negotiate, it stops and calls for a remote human operator to assist. Over a reliable network connection (based on a network bonding solution that utilizes several independent cellular connections and fuses them into one reliable connection), the operator receives all relevant information from the vehicle cameras and sensors and decides how to best resolve the edge case for the vehicle.
This can involve indirect control, such as selecting or drawing a path for the AV to execute, or direct control, such as driving the vehicle using the steering wheel and pedals at the teleoperation station.

EVs as a Dealership Service Opportunity
Background: Nate Chenenko founded and leads the mobility practice of Carlisle & Co., an auto industry consulting firm in Concord, Mass.
Forum focus: It’s widely believed that electrified vehicles will need less service, threatening dealer and automaker profits. But Carlisle’s research suggests that any negative impact may be mitigated because EV owners prefer franchised dealerships for service over independent shops or chain repair stores, given the high-quality promise that dealers can make.
A Conversation With Dick Chitty

The way our cities are built determines mobility needs and how they can be met. Development, urban design and public spaces, building and zoning regulations, parking requirements, and other land use policies shall incentivize compact, accessible, livable, and sustainable cities.\"""", ""5"": ""Here are edited excerpts of Chase's email interview with Editor Leslie J. Allen."", ""6"": ""Q: How do you personally define a livable city?"", ""7"": ""A: I conjure up a streetscape and a city where 8-year-olds and 80-year-olds, and my past self when I was 16, 21, 35 and 40, with children and without children, living on a shoestring budget, or my professional tightly scheduled self, can get around easily. Livable implies I travel without fear for my safety, with enjoyment of my surroundings, with clean air and low stress."", ""8"": ""Q: To what extent are cities putting the principles into practice? any standouts?"", ""9"": ""A: Both Paris and Pittsburgh signed on early, and it is clear those cities have taken these ideas to heart. In Paris they continue to push for efficient use of public streets by allocating more lanes to bicycles, taxis and buses, and making it more inconvenient and slower for personal cars to be used. Pittsburgh has just brought in a collective of shared mobility providers with whom it will work to make alternatives to personal car ownership more convenient and safer in the city, and give vulnerable populations better and more affordable choices to travel."", ""10"": ""I recently co-founded NUMO, a global alliance of public- and private-sector organizations working to align actions and values to create transformational, on-the-ground change.

If we want people to be able to choose the right mode for each trip instead of going everywhere by their own car, we need to make walking, biking and transit safe, convenient and reliable. And in addition to those choices, we know that for some trips — off the public transit grid; or when you are carrying heavy loads, freight or children; or late at night; or when you aren't feeling well — a personal car, a shared personal car, is the best choice. If we don't offer up a shared-vehicle choice, people will revert back to owning their own, which takes up more street storage space, and which encourages more urban driving due to sunk costs."", ""13"": ""Q: what would you change about how cities approach mobility planning?"", ""14"": ""A: Remove parking minimums! [Some cities require parking spaces for new buildings.] Create a safe bike network.

Chase is best known for co-founding car-sharing company Zipcar in 1999. Twenty years later, she's still helping to transform cities.
One way is through the Shared Mobility Principles for Livable Cities, created in 2017 to guide urban decision-makers in these times of rapid technology-driven innovation from the private sector.
Government agencies and mobility companies worldwide have adopted the 10 principles, the first of which reads: ""We plan our cities and their mobility together. The way our cities are built determines mobility needs and how they can be met. Development, urban design and public spaces, building and zoning regulations, parking requirements, and other land use policies shall incentivize compact, accessible, livable, and sustainable cities.""
Here are edited excerpts of Chase's email interview with Editor Leslie J. Allen.
Q: How do you personally define a livable city?
A: I conjure up a streetscape and a city where 8-year-olds and 80-year-olds, and my past self when I was 16, 21, 35 and 40, with children and without children, living on a shoestring budget, or my professional tightly scheduled self, can get around easily. Livable implies I travel without fear for my safety, with enjoyment of my surroundings, with clean air and low stress.
Q: To what extent are cities putting the principles into practice? any standouts?
A: Both Paris and Pittsburgh signed on early, and it is clear those cities have taken these ideas to heart. In Paris they continue to push for efficient use of public streets by allocating more lanes to bicycles, taxis and buses, and making it more inconvenient and slower for personal cars to be used. Pittsburgh has just brought in a collective of shared mobility providers with whom it will work to make alternatives to personal car ownership more convenient and safer in the city, and give vulnerable populations better and more affordable choices to travel.
I recently co-founded NUMO, a global alliance of public- and private-sector organizations working to align actions and values to create transformational, on-the-ground change. Part of the alliance's work is to operationalize the 10 principles.
Q: How do shared vehicles fit in a livable landscape?
A: Shared personal vehicles are an important part of a multimodal lifestyle in our urban future, which is by definition densely populated. If we want people to be able to choose the right mode for each trip instead of going everywhere by their own car, we need to make walking, biking and transit safe, convenient and reliable. And in addition to those choices, we know that for some trips — off the public transit grid; or when you are carrying heavy loads, freight or children; or late at night; or when you aren't feeling well — a personal car, a shared personal car, is the best choice. If we don't offer up a shared-vehicle choice, people will revert back to owning their own, which takes up more street storage space, and which encourages more urban driving due to sunk costs.
Q: what would you change about how cities approach mobility planning?
A: Remove parking minimums! [Some cities require parking spaces for new buildings.] Create a safe bike network. These are responses to Shared Mobility Principle 3: Make efficient use of curbs, lanes, and vehicles.
Q: What else is on your agenda?
A: I think we need to press for fair data requirements across all modes. I don't want to see shared transport trips have no privacy protections and private car trips be the only way you can maintain privacy. This sends exactly the wrong signals.","Want to know what drives transportation entrepreneur Robin Chase?

Now those same automakers are enlisting EDAG to make similar factory changes in North America, says Jan Schulte, CEO of EDAG USA.
""German automakers are already very involved in this change. But now they're saying, why aren't we doing this in the U.S. market?
""We expect significant growth in the United States. Ford is talking about it. GM is talking about it.""
But those auto plant transformations will have implications for North American suppliers, he said. It will require suppliers to get involved — meaning new tooling and process.
""The only way it works is with integrated suppliers,"" Schulte said. ""You have to have your suppliers following your practices. So when this new practice comes into OEMs here, it will have to be introduced across their entire supply chain.
""It will be like the introduction of just-in-sequence practices,"" he added. ""You can't achieve it unless everyone in the chain is participating.""
Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen have been eager adopters of Industry 4.0 concepts. Industry 4.0 — also vaguely referred to as ""The Internet of Things"" — refers to factories that are retooled and rewired to allow machinery to communicate, enable greater automation and incorporate data from up and down the supply chain.
But Schulte said EDAG, which reported 2018 global revenue of $871 million, is also working with Detroit automakers, both in North America and Europe, on the automation trend.
What is propelling the interest in the new technology, Schulte said, is a feeling among automakers that updated product portfolios are no longer enough to differentiate brands — that competitiveness now requires tight-running factories with an increased ability to respond to customer orders, market shifts and supply line interruptions.
EDAG and the Detroit engineering company that it acquired two years ago, CKGP/PW & Associates, are positioning themselves to take advantage of this growth opportunity in North America.
The companies previously operated in offices a mile apart from each other, divided by Detroit's I-75, with about 100 employees at each site. Including a satellite Silicon Valley engineering office, the U.S. operations employ about 240 people.
The two firms have now merged into the same new location in Troy, Mich., and Schulte said he anticipates combined employment to reach 500.
Phil Stevens, president of the CKGP business, said the two operations are now working in unison on new projects. CKGP historically was been a paint plant engineering company, largely focused on General Motors and FCA, while EDAG has focused on vehicle engineering, electronics and manufacturing lines, with its primary involvement with European customers.
Stevens said the combined company now has the ability to engineer a complete vehicle launch, from product engineering through complete manufacturing lines.
The cost of introducing 4.0 networks will vary dramatically from supplier to supplier, Stevens said.

Kia Motors America justifiably terminated a franchisee that repeatedly failed to staff the dealership's service and parts department adequately, the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled.
The court upheld the automaker's right to terminate for ""good cause"" under its 2007 dealer sales and service agreement with Kia of Somersworth. The dealership is now closed, said Kevin Fitzgerald, a lawyer for Kia in Manchester, N.H.
Starting in March 2011, Kia notified the dealership about ""perceived staffing and training deficiencies,"" including ""failure to meet technician training requirements, to adequately staff and train personnel in its parts and service department and to meet the minimum number of technicians required to participate in Kia's Optima Hybrid Program,"" the court said.
In November 2014, at a time when the dealership had no service manager, service adviser or parts counter staff member, Kia gave the store 60 days to ""cure the staffing breach."" In February 2015, Kia sent a 90-day termination notice, saying the dealership ""did not have a single position filled in its parts and service department that was required under the dealer agreement,"" according to the court ruling.
The New Hampshire Motor Vehicle Industry Board rejected the dealership's protest of the franchise termination. It noted that the store had four service managers during one six-month period, and said Kia management had worked with the dealership to try to correct deficiencies.
The dealership unsuccessfully argued that it couldn't hire staff ""due to an unprecedented tight labor market for automobile service workers in the area,"" the court said. Fitzgerald told Fixed Ops Journal that other Kia franchisees in northeast New England haven't had that problem.

Dealership, not insurer, must pay arbitration award

A Texas dealership that didn't notify its insurer of an arbitration demand by its fired collision center manager is on the hook for a $334,992 arbitration award, a federal judge ruled.
U.S. District Chief Judge Lee Rosenthal rejected the argument that Central Houston Nissan wasn't required to tell Federal Insurance Co. that Chris Singleton had filed for arbitration of wrongful termination and breach of contract claims. The store had an employment practices liability policy with Federal.
According to the decision, Singleton became the body shop manager in February 2016. It said he allegedly discovered the shop was ""fraudulently billing auto insurers"" for repairs and was fired a day after conveying his suspicions to his supervisor. Singleton later reported his concerns to the state insurance department, said his lawyer, Brannon Robertson of Houston.
The dealership notified Federal when Singleton sued it in state court and again when he voluntarily dropped the lawsuit. However, the store failed to notify Federal about the subsequent arbitration until after the arbitrator concluded that Singleton was wrongfully fired for refusing ""to participate in illegal and fraudulent activity"" and awarded damages for lost earnings.
Siding with the insurer, Rosenthal said Central Houston Nissan failed to give timely notice of the arbitration demand, as Federal's policy required.
Robertson said the Texas Court of Appeals is reviewing the store's challenge to the arbitration award. Lawyers for the dealership and insurer didn't respond to requests for comment.

Negligent-repair suit against dealership nixed on appeal

An appeals court refused to reinstate a negligence suit against a Ford dealership in Charleroi, Pa., by a customer whose conversion van caught fire after undergoing warranty work.
Carl Miller claimed Davies Ford negligently repaired his 1993 Ford E150 after a 2009 recall. The recall notice warned that a speed control deactivation switch could start a fire in the engine compartment.
Five days after the repair, Miller's unattended van caught fire while the engine was off, damaging the interior and the engine compartment, the suit claimed.
Miller offered a report from a mechanic who concluded that the fire started in an area of the compartment where the switch was located. But because the mechanic didn't testify, the trial judge dismissed the case before jury deliberations could begin.
In a unanimous decision, a Pennsylvania Superior Court panel sided with Davies Ford, saying: ""A defect or mechanical failure in an automobile is a case involving special skills and training which requires expert testimony to prove negligence. Whether the [switch] was correctly serviced and whether [it] malfunctioned are determinations beyond the skills and training of an ordinary layperson.""
Donald McCormick, a lawyer for Davies Ford, told Fixed Ops Journal that the dealership's fire expert ""determined that the part replaced by the dealer did not cause the fire, and furthermore, this part wasn't even in the area of the fire.
The investigator was of the opinion that the fire was intentionally set in another portion of the engine.""

Federal judge tosses suit over seized grilles

A federal judge in Delaware dismissed a lawsuit accusing U.S. Customs and Border Protection of wrongfully seizing repair grilles, ruling that aftermarket parts importer LKQ Corp. followed the wrong procedures when it sued the Department of Homeland Security. U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika said her court lacks authority to review the agency's rejection of LKQ's petitions to force CBP to release the grilles.
The suit challenged more than 165 allegedly ""unlawful seizures"" of grilles since April 2017 at three ports: International Falls, Minn.; Long Beach, Calif.; and Savannah, Ga. It disputed CBP's claim that the grilles were counterfeit or violated automakers' trademarks.
Noreika said LKQ should have taken steps to force the agency to refer the dispute to the U.S. attorneys' offices where the grilles were seized, and then go to court for a review of applicable trademark laws.
LKQ's attorney, Barry Irwin of Chicago, said: ""For nearly a year, the government was seizing LKQ's grilles and refusing to initiate forfeiture proceedings.

Kia Motors America justifiably terminated a franchisee that repeatedly failed to staff the dealership's service and parts department adequately, the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled.
the New Hampshire Supreme Court upheld the automaker's right to terminate for ""good cause"" under the New Hampshire Supreme Court 2007 dealer sales and service agreement with Kia of Somersworth. the dealership is now closed, said Kevin Fitzgerald, a lawyer for Kia in Manchester, N.H.
Starting in March 2011, Kia notified the dealership about ""perceived staffing and training deficiencies,"" including ""failure to meet technician training requirements, to adequately staff and train personnel in Kia parts and service department and to meet the minimum number of technicians required to participate in Kia's Optima Hybrid Program,"" the court said.
In November 2014, at a time when the dealership had no service manager, service adviser or parts counter staff member, Kia gave the store 60 days to ""cure the staffing breach."" In February 2015, Kia sent a 90-day termination notice, saying the dealership ""did not have a single position filled in the dealership parts and service department that was required under the dealer agreement,"" according to the court ruling.
The New Hampshire Motor Vehicle Industry Board rejected the dealership's protest of the franchise termination. The New Hampshire Motor Vehicle Industry Board noted that the store had four service managers during one six-month period, and said Kia management had worked with the dealership to try to correct deficiencies.
the dealership unsuccessfully argued that the dealership couldn't hire staff ""due to an unprecedented tight labor market for automobile service workers in the area,"" "" the court said. Fitzgerald told Fixed Ops Journal that other Kia franchisees in northeast New England haven't had that problem.

Dealership, not insurer, must pay arbitration award

A Texas dealership that didn't notify Dealership insurer of an arbitration demand by Dealership fired collision center manager is on the hook for a $334,992 arbitration award, a federal judge ruled.
U.S. District Chief Judge Lee Rosenthal rejected the argument that Central Houston Nissan wasn't required to tell Federal Insurance Co. that Chris Singleton had filed for arbitration of wrongful termination and breach of contract claims. the store had an employment practices liability policy with Federal.
According to the decision, Chris Singleton became the body shop manager in February 2016. It said Chris Singleton allegedly discovered the shop was ""fraudulently billing auto insurers"" for repairs and was fired a day after conveying Chris Singleton suspicions to Chris Singleton supervisor. Chris Singleton later reported Chris Singleton concerns to the state insurance department, said Chris Singleton lawyer, Brannon Robertson of Houston.
Chris Singleton notified Federal when Chris Singleton sued Federal in state court and again when Chris Singleton voluntarily dropped the lawsuit. However, the store failed to notify Federal about the subsequent arbitration until after the arbitrator concluded that Chris Singleton was wrongfully fired for refusing ""to participate in illegal and fraudulent activity"" and awarded damages for lost earnings.
Siding with the insurer, Rosenthal said Central Houston Nissan failed to give timely notice of the arbitration demand, as Federal's policy required.
Brannon Robertson said the Texas Court of Appeals is reviewing the store's challenge to the arbitration award. Lawyers for the dealership and insurer didn't respond to requests for comment.

Negligent-repair suit against dealership nixed on appeal

An appeals court refused to reinstate a negligence suit against a Ford dealership in Charleroi, Pa., by a customer whose conversion van caught fire after undergoing warranty work.
Carl Miller claimed Davies Ford negligently repaired Carl Miller 1993 Ford E150 after a 2009 recall. The recall notice warned that a speed control deactivation switch could start a fire in the engine compartment.
Five days after the repair, Carl Miller's unattended van caught fire while the engine was off, damaging the interior and the engine compartment, a negligence suit against a Ford dealership in Charleroi, Pa. claimed.
Carl Miller offered a report from a mechanic who concluded that fire started in an area of the compartment where the switch was located. But because a mechanic who concluded that the fire started in an area of the compartment where the switch was located didn't testify, the trial judge dismissed the case before jury deliberations could begin.
In a unanimous decision, a Pennsylvania Superior Court panel sided with Davies Ford, saying: ""A defect or mechanical failure in an automobile is a case involving special skills and training which requires expert testimony to prove negligence. Whether the [switch] was correctly serviced and whether [the [switch]] malfunctioned are determinations beyond the skills and training of an ordinary layperson.""
Donald McCormick, a lawyer for Davies Ford, told Fixed Ops Journal that the dealership's fire expert ""determined that the part replaced by the dealer did not cause fire, and furthermore, the part replaced by the dealer wasn't even in the area of fire.
The investigator was of the opinion that fire was intentionally set in another portion of the engine.""

Federal judge tosses suit over seized grilles

U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika dismissed a lawsuit accusing U.S. Customs and Border Protection of wrongfully seizing repair grilles, ruling that aftermarket parts importer LKQ Corp. followed the wrong procedures when aftermarket parts importer LKQ Corp. sued the Department of Homeland Security. U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika said U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika court lacks authority to review the agency's rejection of LKQ's petitions to force CBP to release the grilles.
The suit challenged more than 165 allegedly ""unlawful seizures"" of grilles since April 2017 at three ports: International Falls, Minn.; Long Beach, Calif.; and Savannah, Ga. It disputed CBP's claim that the grilles were counterfeit or violated automakers' trademarks.
U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika said LKQ should have taken steps to force the agency to refer the dispute to the U.S. attorneys' offices where the grilles were seized, and then go to court for a review of applicable trademark laws.
LKQ's attorney, Barry Irwin of Chicago, said: ""For nearly a year, the government was seizing LKQ's grilles and refusing to initiate forfeiture proceedings. As the result of the Delaware litigation, and more than a year after the seizures began, the government began referring the matters to the local U.S. attorneys — as the government should have already done — and local U.S. attorneys finally initiated the government's first forfeiture proceedings.""
Irwin said LKQ ""looks forward to finally obtaining judicial review of the government's unlawful seizure of the government repair grilles, most of which the government has been importing without incident for more than a decade."""

Sonic Automotive is trimming more than 6 percent of its corporate and regional work force — part of $20 million in savings the company has identified this year.
The retailer cited new-vehicle sales volatility among its concerns and said it is factoring in three possible interest rate hikes in 2019. Sonic said its mix of luxury brands and higher inventory values make it especially vulnerable to higher rates.
The actions follow a corporate restructuring announced last month by AutoNation. The No. 1 U.S. dealership group cited slower industrywide sales as a key reason for cuts.
Sonic, the nation’s fifth-largest auto retailer, wouldn’t disclose how many employees it laid off in the first quarter, but company President Jeff Dyke said the cuts included positions at corporate headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., and across its five regions. No cuts were made to dealership staff, he said.
“We’ve eliminated IT projects, we’ve eliminated a number of projects overall, which then allowed us to make some of the head count cuts,” Dyke told Automotive News.
CEO David Smith said Sonic has eliminated several distractions, allowing it to focus on growing its EchoPark standalone used-vehicle stores and its core business.
“We have a lot of things to take our time and our energy and our capital,” Smith said. “And we’re focusing on the things that have the biggest return for us and for our company.”
In January, AutoNation announced a $50 million restructuring that included consolidating three regions into two and eliminating corporate and regional jobs. The company also said four top executives including its COO were leaving.
Still, in a note to investors, Glenn Chin, director of equity research for Buckingham Research Group, said Sonic’s negative outlook on 2019 “diverges from most auto retail peers.”
Sonic has a history of high fixed costs compared with its peer group, said Bret Jordan, a retail analyst with Jefferies.
“You could argue that they were more in need of a cost cut than AutoNation,” Jordan told Automotive News.
He said Sonic likely built up overhead with its One Sonic-One Experience no-haggle, speedy transaction sales approach — now on the back burner — and from other initiatives.
“Now that you’ve got a declining market, it’s important to take out some of those costs,” Jordan said.
He said other public retailers may restructure or cut staff if new-vehicle sales drop more than predicted this year.
Sonic CFO Heath Byrd told analysts last week that the company also is reducing capital spending by $55 million this year and seeks to lower debt by $300 million over the next 12 to 18 months.
Dyke said the job cuts would not impact Sonic’s plans to open a call center in Lowell, N.C., a Charlotte suburb. The $11.2 million operation is expected to create 500 jobs, according to a December news release from the North Carolina governor’s office.
Sonic is converting a dealership to house customer service agents who will field Internet and phone leads from across the company. About 100 employees at a nearby call center will move to the Lowell operation, which is expected to open this year.
Sonic’s job cuts were part of a fourth-quarter earnings report in which net income dropped nearly two-thirds to $22 million. That decline was blamed in part on a sales dip in Houston, where Hurricane Harvey had sparked deliveries a year earlier, and weaker performance of its BMW and Honda stores. Those brands represent 37 percent of Sonic’s profits.
Dyke said BMW sales in the fourth-quarter were down 13 percent, while Honda sales dropped 8 percent from a year earlier. Sonic’s BMW and Honda profits last year dropped by a combined $20 million, Dyke said.
“When BMW and Honda don’t perform at the levels that we need them to perform at — they’re such a large part of our overall mix — it just causes us issues,” he told analysts.

The Encore's success is one reason Aldred decided to kill the compact Verano sedan for the U.S. market in 2016.
Even so, Buick executives say there's enough differentiation between Buick's crossover-dominated lineup and the GMC products sold in Buick executives combined dealerships. Buick and GMC, according to Aldred and Brook, have created separate identities: GMC as the more rugged and ""crafted"" one, while Buick is elegant and ""obtainable, quiet luxury.""
""The character is very well-defined,"" Aldred said last month referring to Buick. ""We just have to keep playing that formula.""

For consumers, Zotye USA executives say they will offer no-haggle pricing, online sales and affordable vehicles.
For dealers who elect to sign up to sell the Zotye crossover, there are no demands for expensive dealerships, something established automakers typically require.
Zotye (pronounced ZOH'-tay) aims to ""really shake things up,"" said Bob Pradzinski, a longtime Hyundai Motor America executive who will head sales for the new entity.
Zotye USA was created last month after parent company HAAH Automotive Holdings of Lake Forest, Calif., signed a distributorship agreement with the small Chinese automaker Zotye Automobile International Co. It plans to launch in 80 top U.S. markets and have 300 to 325 franchised dealers when its first vehicle, likely the T600 crossover sold in China since 2013, goes on sale, slated for the fourth quarter of 2020.
But there's a lot of work to do first.
Pradzinski, senior vice president of sales at HAAH and Zotye USA, and Duke Hale, a former Mazda and Volvo executive and now CEO of HAAH Automotive Holdings and Zotye USA, are working on recruiting dealers. Letters of intent are signed with some dealers. The company declined to provide their names or how many have signed up.
Zotye is not considering any company- owned stores.
""We really want to do this hand in hand with dealers. I think this idea of trying to sell cars and satisfy customers and companies saying they're only going to do it online, I just think that's not going to work,"" Pradzinski said. ""You have to be customer-friendly; you have to be dealer-friendly. We're also going to be supplier-friendly and employee-friendly. The company has to work for everyone.""
HAAH and Zotye USA aim to announce the first 20 or so dealers in about a month.
Hale and Pradzinski have held dealer meetings on the East and West coasts and are encouraging interested dealers to contact them through haahauto.com. They are seeking dealers with strong businesses, good sales volume and repair capability and high customer service scores. While Zotye mainly is focused on existing new-car dealers, it would consider individuals with extensive retail auto experience.
Not typical
But any who sign on also must recognize that Zotye USA plans to go to market in a different fashion than the typical franchised dealership, with regard to pricing and customers.
""We want dealers that buy into this fact that we're in the Amazon age and that, you know what, dealerships need to change,"" Pradzinski told Automotive News. ""They're really going to have to buy into this process. People don't want the hassle anymore.""
Pradzinski doesn't want customers in Zotye stores to worry about haggling and not knowing whether they got the best price. He wants to create an experience customers will love instead of them facing the typical bombardment by salespeople the minute they step onto a lot.
""That's what has to be changed,"" he said. ""We have to make it a very customer-friendly experience.""
Dealers will get only one vehicle to sell at first, a crossover that HAAH and Zotye officials did not disclose but was identified last week on HAAH's website as the T600.
Zotye Automobile International Co., with global sales of 317,000 vehicles last year and aspirations to become internationally competitive, said that, after launching the crossover in the U.S., it plans to sell sedans and electric vehicles here by partnering with HAAH.
Dealers will have realistic facility requirements, a longtime hot-button issue between dealers and automakers. The approach will be simple and minimalistic, Pradzinski said. Showrooms will include red and silver colors, ""plain and basic, but very, very functional and not super expensive."" Signage will be scaled back from pricey pole-and-monument signs some automakers require, he said.
Dealers could share the Zotye showroom with another brand or convert a used-car building to use. A Zotye dealer may be able to have a satellite store in a shopping mall or warehouse district that isn't as expensive as an auto mall row, he said. After all, today's shoppers are smart and know the cost of a fancy facility is built into the price of the product, Pradzinski said.
""We won't require Taj Mahals that are costing dealers millions,"" he said. ""I think that's the fastest way to build a brand.""
Website plans
Zotye plans a website to give customers ""all the information you can imagine"" about the vehicle, plus information typically available only at the dealership, such as how their credit score will affect payments, Pradzinski said. Online sales will be available to customers, but buyers would take delivery at a dealership.
""We are not going to do something online that takes a sale away from a dealer,"" he said.
Pradzinski said the company is in negotiations with major lenders to serve the brand, and it intends to offer a warranty.
Zotye faces ""plenty"" of challenges as it prepares to launch U.S. sales -- including risk of a recession and of tariffs on vehicles coming from China, said Ivan Drury, senior manager of industry analysis for Edmunds. Tariffs could turn off some consumers even if the company picks up some or all of the cost, as Hale said last week was a possibility.
Marketing will be key, as perception of Chinese-made products varies, Drury said. And while aiming to be different through customer service and no-haggle pricing could work, there is still a widespread belief among consumers that negotiating saves money.
""The marketing approach is huge, and emphasizing those points is good. At the same point, it really comes down to the product,"" Drury said. ""You could have a terrible experience but still purchase a car.""
Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book, said Zotye will have to find risk-minded consumers willing to buy from an unknown company. Trying to break into the U.S. also poses risks for the company and dealers, she said.
""People just greatly underestimate the capital investment needed to penetrate the U.S. market,"" Lindland said. ""If you're coming out with one car, you're competing against a behemoth, whether it's General Motors or Tesla, that are incredibly well-funded. Now you're asking dealers to commit to this one product for some period in time.""
Red tape
HAAH and Zotye officials admit they have a lot to complete in two years, but they have started to work on state regulatory approvals to set up franchised dealerships. Zotye has been working with a consulting company for several months on vehicle homologation and is ""very comfortable"" it will meet safety, emissions and other certification requirements needed to sell an imported vehicle in the U.S. by the fourth quarter of 2020, said Chris Hosford, HAAH and Zotye USA's vice president of public relations.
Hale tried to call National Automobile Dealers Association President Peter Welch before Zotye's announcement last week to reiterate the company's commitment to franchised dealers, Hosford said.
NADA spokesman Jared Allen said Welch returned Hale's call but the two hadn't connected. The association just learned about the company and its aspirations last week.
HAAH and Zotye officials plan to attend the NADA Show in January in San Francisco, but it may be too late for Zotye to secure floor space.
The company has a draft dealer agreement, Pradzinski said, but wants input from dealers and NADA before finalizing it.
NADA has informally asked U.S. dealers how they feel about a Chinese automaker entering the U.S. and whether they would be willing to take on a franchise. The response largely has been positive, assuming those automakers deliver high-quality products, Allen said.
Guangzhou Automobile Group met with dealers at the NADA Show this year about the prospect of entering the U.S. retail market next year. A Guangzhou spokeswoman said it has not announced dealer network plans but still aims to debut the GS8 crossover for sale in the U.S. in late 2019 or early 2020.
Executives speaking at the Paris auto show last month dialed back Guangzhou's entry timeline likely to the first half of 2020, as the company considers the tariff issues between the U.S. and China.

","Zotye USA's plan to start selling a Chinese-made crossover in the U.S. two years from now addresses common gripes from both consumers and dealers.
For consumers, Zotye USA executives say Zotye USA executives will offer no-haggle pricing, online sales and affordable vehicles.
For dealers who elect to sign up to sell the Zotye crossover, there are no demands for expensive dealerships, something established automakers typically require.
Zotye (pronounced ZOH'-tay) aims to ""really shake things up,"" said Bob Pradzinski, a longtime Hyundai Motor America executive who will head sales for the new entity.
Zotye USA was created last month after parent company HAAH Automotive Holdings of Lake Forest, Calif., signed a distributorship agreement with the small Chinese automaker Zotye Automobile International Co. Zotye Automobile International Co. plans to launch in 80 top U.S. markets and have 300 to 325 franchised dealers when Zotye Automobile International Co. first vehicle, likely the T600 crossover sold in China since 2013, goes on sale, slated for the fourth quarter of 2020.
But there's a lot of work to do first.
Pradzinski, senior vice president of sales at HAAH and Zotye USA, and Duke Hale, a former Mazda and Volvo executive and now CEO of HAAH Automotive Holdings and Zotye USA, are working on recruiting dealers. Letters of intent are signed with some dealers. Zotye Automobile International Co. declined to provide their names or how many have signed up.
Zotye is not considering any company- owned stores.
""Zotye Automobile International Co. really want to do this hand in hand with dealers. I think this idea of trying to sell cars and satisfy customers and companies saying customers and companies're only going to do it online, I just think that's not going to work,"" Pradzinski said. ""You have to be customer-friendly; you have to be dealer-friendly. Zotye Automobile International Co.'re also going to be supplier-friendly and employee-friendly. Zotye Automobile International Co. has to work for everyone.""
HAAH and Zotye USA aim to announce the first 20 or so dealers in about a month.
Hale and Pradzinski have held dealer meetings on the East and West coasts and are encouraging interested dealers to contact Hale and Pradzinski through haahauto.com. Hale and Pradzinski are seeking dealers with strong businesses, good sales volume and repair capability and high customer service scores. While Zotye mainly is focused on existing new-car dealers, Zotye would consider individuals with extensive retail auto experience.
Not typical
But any who sign on also must recognize that Zotye USA plans to go to market in a different fashion than the typical franchised dealership, with regard to pricing and customers.
""We want dealers that buy into this fact that We're in the Amazon age and that, you know what, dealerships need to change,"" Pradzinski told Automotive News. ""dealerships're really going to have to buy into this process. People don't want the hassle anymore.""
Pradzinski doesn't want customers in Zotye stores to worry about haggling and not knowing whether customers in Zotye stores got the best price. ""
Pradzinski wants to create an experience customers will love instead of customers facing the typical bombardment by salespeople the minute customers step onto a lot.
""That's what has to be changed,"" ""
Pradzinski said. ""We have to make it a very customer-friendly experience.""

Lynk & CO vehicles are assembled at two plants in China, one that also makes Volvo vehicles and another that is dedicated to Lynk & CO. The 01 plug-in hybrid is slated to be assembled at Volvo's plant in Ghent, Belgium. And Visser said Lynk & CO is looking at possibly building vehicles at Volvo's new plant in Ridgeville, S.C., after Lynk & CO lands stateside.
To telegraph Lynk & CO lands global ambition and unorthodox thinking, Lynk & CO hosted an over-the-top launch event for the 03 in Japan, where Lynk & CO has only the vaguest plans of ever doing business.
Commandeering Fuji Speedway, Lynk & CO flew in hundreds of Chinese journalists for the spectacle. It encompassed test drives on the Formula One circuit and an evening extravaganza replete with a fashion show, fog machines, stunt drivers and a helicopter flyover.
The 03 will go on sale equipped with a 1.5-liter, three-cylinder turbocharged engine mated to a 7-speed dual clutch transmission, all shared with other Lynk & CO vehicles and Volvo. A plug-in hybrid is planned for next year. And Lynk & CO says Lynk & CO will add an EV at the end of 2020.
Lynk & CO vehicles are mostly developed by engineers in Sweden and share almost all Lynk & CO vehicles innards, from platform to powertrain, with Volvo. But Andreas Nilsson, senior vice president for design, says everything the customers see and touch is distinct to the Lynk & CO brand.
To cultivate more of a performance persona, Lynk & CO announced at Fuji Speedway that the Lynk & CO brand would enter an 03-based race car in the 2019 World Touring Car Cup series. A concept of the car, with a huge rear wing, boasts 500 hp, compared with 180 hp for the street version.
Why chase a sports pedigree when Lynk & CO subscription model envisions a steady clip of trade ins and a brisk business in car-sharing? And why bother with a debut in Japan, where Lynk & CO still hasn't set a timeline for starting sales? For Lynk & CO, it's about standing out.
Said Visser: ""We like to do the unexpected."""

The government is scaling back subsidies to place more emphasis on the need for technological improvements to ensure the industry's long-term success. As part of new rules that went into effect on Feb. 12, China lowered subsidies by varying degrees for EVs with a driving range of less than 300 kilometers. At the same time, the incentive for those that have a range of 400 kilometers and beyond was raised to 50,000 yuan.
ˇ°Government policy has a huge impact over the new-energy vehicle sector and every adjustment made on the policy front over the next two years will result in tremendous changes in the industry,ˇ± Li Yixiu, sales chief for Beijing Electric Vehicle Co., China's biggest maker of EVs, told reporters on July 5.
ˇ°We believe there isn't a chance for carmakers to raise prices to make up for the reduction of government fundings,ˇ± Li said. ˇ°Instead, we have to come up with competitive new products and services to respond.ˇ±
BJEV, as the company is known, has started offering battery-swap and rental services to consumers to help lower purchase costs and ease range anxiety. The company sells a version of its EV300 compact car for 79,800 yuan that allows users to change batteries as often as they want for a monthly fee of 432 yuan.
The century-long dominance of gasoline-engine cars will sputter in coming decades as incentivized Chinese buyers and more-efficient manufacturers combine to put EVs atop the sales leader board.
By 2040, more than half of all new car sales and a third of the planet's automobile fleet -- equal to 559 million vehicles -- will be electric, according to a global outlook published by BNEF in May. EVs will achieve upfront cost parity with internal-combustion engines beginning in the mid-2020s, helping trigger a tectonic shift in car sales, it said.
ˇ°There has been a spurt of innovation in the industry,ˇ± said Steve Man, a senior autos analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence in Hong Kong. ˇ°This is a much needed transformation for the Chinese EV market.ˇ±

","China is considering a further reduction in electric-vehicle subsidies next year as the government pushes automakers to innovate rather than rely on fiscal policy to spur demand for alternative-energy cars, people familiar with the plan said.
The average sales incentive per EV may be lowered by more than a third from the 2018 levels, said the people, who asked not to be identified disclosing information that isn't public.
Vehicles may be required to be able to go at least 200 kilometers (125 miles) on a single charge to be eligible for incentives, up from 150 kilometers currently, said the people. the plan is still under discussion and subject to changes, the people said.
Subsidies have been key to making plug-in hybrids and EVs from companies such as BYD Co., backed by Warren Buffett, more affordable to Chinese consumers and helping China surpass the U.S. as the world's biggest in 2015.
the government spent 6.64 billion yuan ($1 billion) last year funding consumers' purchases of such autos. On top of what the government spends, Chinese cities and provinces separately offer incentives to make EVs more appealing in a country where automakers from Volkswagen AG to Ford Motor Co. are planning to increase EV offerings.

And so, like amoebas under a microscope, parts makers are splitting in two, separating self-driving operations from drivetrain business units, old technologies from new, or selling off divisions deemed inessential for growth in the new era of electrified, connected and autonomous vehicles."", ""4"": ""In the past 24 months, the industry has witnessed such \""de-mergers\"" at Delphi, Johnson Controls, Autoliv and Faurecia. Honeywell has put its turbocharger division on the block. GKN tried to stave off a hostile takeover by splitting its automotive and aerospace divisions, and that scenario is still unfolding. Even the German technology giant Continental is considering a structural overhaul. There are several reasons for the global trend, executives and analysts say. For one, Wall Street and the rest of the world's investment sector believe there is greater earnings potential in the high-tech trends that are roiling the auto industry — autonomous drive, electrification and connectivity — than in nuts-and-bolts auto parts, however profitable they may be now."", ""5"": ""Suppliers themselves say that by separating out a tightly focused and independent business, it won't have to fight for resources within a diverse conglomerate. And smaller, single-purpose companies also can be quicker to adapt to a fast-changing landscape, whether it's new tech or old tech."", ""6"": ""Supplier r&d is running hotter than ever, as the world will witness this week as thousands of engineers and executives gather in Detroit for the annual industry technology confab SAE International WCX World Congress Experience."", ""7"": ""Automakers are leaning heavily on their parts companies to come up with the necessary innovations to make vehicles drive themselves, deliver better fuel economy and talk to each other in traffic.

That's a viable strategy,\"" said Neal Ganguli, a managing director at Deloitte Consulting. \""Then we've seen suppliers who say, 'We're going to shut these businesses and focus on becoming more of a profit seeker.' \"""", ""37"": ""Not every bid to divest or spin off divisions succeeds. The British supplier GKN, facing a hostile takeover by the London investment group Melrose Industries, had been working on divesting its automotive division to focus on aerospace and defense. GKN cited the \""strategic optionality\"" in having \""separate companies with distinct investment profiles and capital allocation policies.\"" It was nearing a deal to sell its automotive operations to Dana, but shareholders late in March voted for Melrose — which had the opposite views on the split."", ""38"": ""In wooing GKN shareholders, Melrose said that \""any actions to immediately separate the businesses in preparation for a sale of one or the other would be value-destructive.\"""", ""39"": ""Ganguli said the current wave of mergers, acquisitions and divestitures is driven by foundational shifts in the auto industry rather than normal business cycles. \""The forces that are driving the transformation are different,\"" he said.

On purpose.
They are convinced that by no longer being conglomerates, they will gain favor from investors and industry customers. And so, like amoebas under a microscope, parts makers are splitting in two, separating self-driving operations from drivetrain business units, old technologies from new, or selling off divisions deemed inessential for growth in the new era of electrified, connected and autonomous vehicles.
In the past 24 months, the industry has witnessed such ""de-mergers"" at Delphi, Johnson Controls, Autoliv and Faurecia. Honeywell has put its turbocharger division on the block. GKN tried to stave off a hostile takeover by splitting its automotive and aerospace divisions, and that scenario is still unfolding. Even the German technology giant Continental is considering a structural overhaul. There are several reasons for the global trend, executives and analysts say. For one, Wall Street and the rest of the world's investment sector believe there is greater earnings potential in the high-tech trends that are roiling the auto industry — autonomous drive, electrification and connectivity — than in nuts-and-bolts auto parts, however profitable they may be now.
Suppliers themselves say that by separating out a tightly focused and independent business, it won't have to fight for resources within a diverse conglomerate. And smaller, single-purpose companies also can be quicker to adapt to a fast-changing landscape, whether it's new tech or old tech.
Supplier r&d is running hotter than ever, as the world will witness this week as thousands of engineers and executives gather in Detroit for the annual industry technology confab SAE International WCX World Congress Experience.
Automakers are leaning heavily on their parts companies to come up with the necessary innovations to make vehicles drive themselves, deliver better fuel economy and talk to each other in traffic. The annual Automotive News PACE Awards, which single out suppliers for their commercialized innovations, will be presented Monday night, April 9, in Detroit.
Not every supplier is following the same script on how to obtain the needed cash and profit margins to deliver whatever it is the auto companies will need over the next decade. But they agree that they need keen focus on their core competencies in an increasingly complex business, analysts said.
""The supplier that was everything to everybody — that's becoming a much more difficult business model,"" said Michael Robinet, a managing director at IHS Markit Automotive. ""Even the larger suppliers are looking inward and saying, 'Where can we see the added value? Where can we see the margins and return on investment that we targeted?' ""
Like Delphi, Swedish supplier Autoliv is banking on future technologies as its growth engine. In September the company announced that it will become two separate companies, one making the passive-safety systems it is best known for, such as airbags and seat belts, and a separate enterprise that will focus on vision systems, radar products and advanced driver-assistance software.
Autoliv CEO Jan Carlson will move over to head the new company, called Veoneer.
Carlson will have some work to do: The order intake for electronics at Autoliv last year was about $900 million, compared with $2.5 billion for the company's passive safety products. And operating margin for Veoneer is initially expected to be ""low- to mid-single-digit negative,"" Autoliv said in February. Its electronics profits are expected to lag until new products are rolled out in 2019.
Nonetheless, the split has won the blessing of financial markets.
Activist investor Cevian Capital in March disclosed that it had taken a 7 percent stake in Autoliv, worth about $850 million, and Cevian co-founder Christer Gardell endorsed the split.
""We are convinced that both Autoliv and Veoneer have strong potential for further value creation,"" he said in a statement.
To be sure, large global companies buy and sell businesses in the normal scheme of things. But the widespread strategy of splitting in two to reposition for a changing industry reality is new. Indeed, for much of the past three decades, suppliers have doggedly pursued expansion by acquisition to make themselves large and diverse enough to cater to any need a customer had.
That philosophy is evolving.
Battery colossus Johnson Controls spent decades building up its automotive seating business into the industry leader through acquisitions and investment. But in 2016 Johnson separated its seating division into a new company called Adient, saying the low-margin seating business required more capital than the company was willing to commit.
The clean-sheet start has energized it.
""Wrapping up our first year, it's been very good for us, on a few different fronts,"" said Byron Foster, Adient's executive vice president in charge of seating for the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. ""We've committed to investing in the business again. The last three to five years under Johnson Controls we were seen more as a cash cow.""
Adient has won $3 billion worth of new business, Foster said, and it will remain focused on seating. ""Our clear strategy is to win at what we think we're world class at, and that's automotive seating,"" he said.
The stock market has agreed: Adient's stock price has risen by about 50 percent since debuting in October 2016, and at one point was nearly double the opening price.
Navigant Research analyst Sam Abuelsamid says the split gives Adient a better chance to survive, even as parts such as seats increasingly become commodity products, and the entire vehicle market levels off in the coming decades as car-sharing increases.
""One of the things that Adient has done over the past year is develop variations of their product lines that are better adapted to the future of shared, autonomous vehicles,"" Abuelsamid said. ""They're going from just building conventional seats to asking, 'How do we re-architect the vehicle interior to better support autonomous vehicles, provide modularity and support different types of user experiences in the vehicle?' ""
Honeywell has announced plans to sell its turbocharger division, a $3 billion-a-year business that is the only automotive-related unit within the huge American conglomerate (market capitalization of $110 billion). The move came after a demand from activist investor Third Point that Honeywell spin off its aerospace division.
""There were no go-to-market synergies with the other businesses,"" Olivier Rabiller, CEO of Honeywell Transportation Systems, said in a December interview with Automotive News Europe. He said the unit would benefit from making its own investment decisions.
""The spinoff is a recognition that Transportation Systems is a successful business and it is in the best interest of Honeywell to position this business to be even more successful in the future,"" he said.
French supplier Faurecia sold its exteriors division to a onetime competitor, Plastic Omnium, for $753 million in 2016. The sale let Faurecia, in which PSA Group holds a controlling stake, retire outstanding debt, but it also gave Faurecia a war chest to acquire companies that are better aligned with its areas of strategic future competence: seating, interiors and clean mobility.
The exteriors division was not sufficiently international and was relatively low-tech, a Faurecia spokesman said.
""The money offered the group new investment capabilities that allow us to complete our technology road map,"" he said, citing its investments last year in Parrot Automotive and Jiangxi Coagent Electronics for connectivity and infotainment systems, and Hug Engineering, which develops exhaust gas purification components.
The move is paying off for Plastic Omnium as well, said Jean-Michel Szczerba, the company's co-CEO. Plastic Omnium wanted to win bumper contracts in the lucrative German market, and that is now happening.
""We wanted to create a relationship for bumpers with Daimler, with Audi and with Ford,"" he said. Last year, Plastic Omnium agreed to provide bumpers for the Mercedes S class.
Plastic Omnium is now seeking to sell its environmental division, which makes waste bins and playground equipment, and was one of the group's original businesses. Instead, the supplier hopes to devote its resources to research into composites and hydrogen fuel cell storage.
Some suppliers are still following the conglomerate model. Robert Bosch, No. 1 on the Automotive News list of the top 100 global suppliers with worldwide automotive sales of $46.5 billion in 2016, also sells home appliances, security systems, business logistics software and even garden tools. The largest Japanese suppliers, including Denso Corp., at No. 4 on the list, and Aisin Seiki Co., at No. 6, have not announced plans to spin off or sell major divisions.
But the biggest breakup could be coming this year. Continental, with a market cap of $43 billion, said it was in talks about a possible restructuring to reach its growth targets. Potential changes reportedly include a spinoff of its tire division.
""The suppliers who choose to consolidate and scale up will be the only player standing in some segments. That's a viable strategy,"" said Neal Ganguli, a managing director at Deloitte Consulting. ""Then we've seen suppliers who say, 'We're going to shut these businesses and focus on becoming more of a profit seeker.' ""
Not every bid to divest or spin off divisions succeeds. The British supplier GKN, facing a hostile takeover by the London investment group Melrose Industries, had been working on divesting its automotive division to focus on aerospace and defense. GKN cited the ""strategic optionality"" in having ""separate companies with distinct investment profiles and capital allocation policies."" It was nearing a deal to sell its automotive operations to Dana, but shareholders late in March voted for Melrose — which had the opposite views on the split.
In wooing GKN shareholders, Melrose said that ""any actions to immediately separate the businesses in preparation for a sale of one or the other would be value-destructive.""
Ganguli said the current wave of mergers, acquisitions and divestitures is driven by foundational shifts in the auto industry rather than normal business cycles. ""The forces that are driving the transformation are different,"" he said. People are thinking about mobility in a fundamentally different way, he said, and the value of a vehicle will increasingly be in its software and coding rather than in hard parts.
""This is going to have a profound impact on the Tier 1 suppliers,"" he said. ""Going forward, they will have to look at what strategies to deploy to be a player and how to win in this new environment.""
Economic cycles may also be playing a role in the flurry of divestments. Parts makers have been along for the ride as the global auto industry surged since the recession, with worldwide light-vehicle production rising to more than 90 million in 2017 from about 60 million in 2009.

GM raised its full-year guidance last week, affirming that it's on track for one of its best annual profits ever -- but so is Ford, despite the weaker third quarter.
Beyond that, about the only similarity between the two companies right now is the level of apathy toward their results on Wall Street, particularly in comparison to the far-less-profitable Tesla. GM shares dropped more than 4 percent last Tuesday after beating analyst expectations by almost 20 percent. Ford shares tumbled after its own announcement on Thursday.
""We imagine this is quite disheartening. There doesn't seem to be much they can say that will alter investor concerns"" about U.S. auto sales peaking, Barclays Capital analyst Brian Johnson wrote of GM. ""We hope that somewhere in the executive suites of the RenCen, ""Shake it Off' is being played on repeat, with management saying ""haters gonna hate.'""","DETROIT -- General Motors and Ford Motor Co. both posted single-digit U.S. sales declines in the third quarter. But financially, DETROIT's two largest automakers appear headed in opposite directions, with GM achieving a record third-quarter profit at the same time that Ford had Ford weakest quarter in nearly two years.
GM is increasing North American production in the third quarter, according to analysts, whereas Ford has taken or scheduled downtime at six of Ford 11 North American assembly plants to reduce inventories.
Time will tell whether Ford is getting ahead of a coming downturn in the market, as Ford did in 2006 by mortgaging major assets before credit markets dried up, or is acting too conservatively at a time when U.S. sales remain near record levels.
""I would call our approach realism. Not optimism, not pessimism; it's realism,"" Ford CEO Mark Fields said on a conference call with analysts last week. ""We don't see a recession on the horizon, but We do see a marketplace that, from a cycle standpoint, it's matured.""
GM's third-quarter results, including record revenue for any quarter since ""
GM 2009 bankruptcy and net income that more than doubled from a year ago, are validation of Ford's retail-focused strategy in U.S., where essentially all of ""
GM profits were generated. GM's retail sales were flat from July through September, while fleet deliveries dropped 15 percent. In contrast, the bulk of Ford's 6 percent decline in third-quarter sales volume was at retail.
""We're running a different play, and it's generating different results,"" GM CFO Chuck Stevens told analysts on Ford's earnings call. ""We're very focused on retail in a very disciplined way. We retail market share is up; We're less reliant on less profitable daily rental, and that's showing up in We results.GM CFO Chuck Stevens GM CFO Chuck Stevens said GM is confident that, even as U.S. sales flatten out after six consecutive years of steady growth, ""we can continue to sustain strong margins in North America like we have done over the past couple of years.""
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles also is on an upward trajectory. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles posted a 29 percent gain in third-quarter net income and raised Fiat Chrysler Automobiles full-year operating profit forecast to at least $6.3 billion.
Meanwhile, Ford's outlook has taken on a more negative tone since midyear. Ford's outlook third-quarter net income fell 56 percent, a drop that executives attributed to a costly recall, ramping up production of the redesigned Super Duty pickup and the plateau in U.S. sales. Ford also cited ""normalization"" of F-150 sales compared with a year ago, when early buyers of the redesigned model were loading early buyers of the redesigned model up with expensive options.
Ford's full-year guidance implies a 23 percent drop in Ford fourth-quarter adjusted pretax profit, while GM's forecast suggests a decline of at least 16 percent in the quarter.
Results from dealership groups, suppliers and lenders have been mixed as consumer demand levels off and growth becomes harder to achieve. Both Lear and Gentex said Both Lear and Gentex third-quarter net income rose 18 percent, but BorgWarner reported a 47 percent decline, and Ally Financial posted a 22 percent drop amid increasing delinquencies and fewer loan originations. AutoNation, Group 1 Automotive and Asbury Automotive Group reported lower earnings, while Penske Automotive managed a slight gain.
Ford generated about $500 more revenue per vehicle sold in the last quarter in North America than GM, but GM's profit per vehicle was more than double that of Ford's. Even when excluding a $600 million charge that Ford took in the quarter for recalling faulty door latches, GM earned 40 percent more from each sale.
The disparity correlates to the higher transaction prices generated from retail sales, which accounted for 85 percent of GM's third-quarter volume and 77 percent of Ford's.
""That all translates right through to the bottom line,"" David Kudla, CEO of Mainstay Capital. ""A car sold at retail versus a car sold at fleet, that's a big deal when you take that down to the net profit per car. It matters.""
GM earned 5.9 percent more in North America during the first nine months of 2016, even though ""
GM U.S. market share fell to just 16.9 percent, a drop of 0.7 points. Ford's share was unchanged through September at 15.1 percent, and Ford North American pretax profits were down 3.7 percent.
GM's stronger results come at a time when Ford is at a low point in Ford product-launch schedule. The 2015 ""Car Wars"" report from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, which asserts that fresh showrooms lead to higher profitability, listed GM's replacement rate in the 2016 and 2017 model years as above average for the industry, while Ford ranked last among the major automakers.

But Honda isn’t trying to supplant Nike’s Air Jordan line. Instead, the automaker is using the HT3 shoe as a bridge to its buyer base.
When Honda examined what Civic consumers were into, style and fashion kept popping up, said Phil Hruska, Honda’s manager of media strategy.
The shoe emerged as Honda was brainstorming on how it could deliver a message centered on fashion and style. The automaker coordinated with The CoLab, an internal branded-content agency for lifestyle news site Thrillist, which conceived the idea. Thrillist often partners with Honda on branded content.

Hruska said the HT3 name stems from the Civic’s three core design cues, which are “high-touch, high-tension and high-tech.” The mission was to apply the Civic’s design language in a way that would make for a shoe that’s fashionable and cutting-edge.
The sleek shoe, which dons a folding cover over the laces, went on sale this week exclusively on JackThreads.com and retails for $100. The shoe debuted on March 29 during an event in Los Angeles.

Hruska said the HT3 is part of the “bigger umbrella” Civic launch. Honda has introduced three new variants in recent months with a sedan, coupe and hatchback.
The HT3 release puts a different spin on branded content, going beyond purely digital outreach to something consumers can actually touch.
When shoe shoppers stop by the HT3 page on JackThreads, the product description emphasizes the Honda Civic connection and links to a Honda-sponsored article telling the backstory of the HT3 on Thrillist.
The shoe is also being pitched on Thrillist through Honda’s “Design in Drive” branded content hub on the site. The HT3 article is accompanied by a Civic ad leading to Honda’s official site where people can locate the nearest Honda dealer and configure the vehicle.

When shoe shoppers stop by the HT3 page on JackThreads, the product description emphasizes the Honda Civic connection and links to a Honda-sponsored article telling the backstory of the HT3 on Thrillist.
an average looking shoe is also being pitched on Thrillist through Honda’s “Design in Drive” branded content hub on the site. a Honda-sponsored article telling the backstory of the HT3 on Thrillist is accompanied by a Civic ad leading to Honda’s official site where people can locate the nearest Honda dealer and configure the vehicle.
So, is it harder to design a good-looking car or shoe?
“A lot more goes into the car, [but] they both have they both unique challenges,” Hruska said. “I think with this project, we were able to get the best of both worlds.”"

Michael McGarry, 58, CEO of PPG, relishes the challenges. By the time he stepped into the top job Sept. 1, McGarry had held 22 jobs that touched nearly every area in the Pittsburgh-based company that supplies coatings for the automotive, architectural, general industrial, packaging and aerospace industries, to name a few.
McGarry talked with Automotive News Staff Reporter Bradford Wernle.


Q: Some suppliers have shied away from being too dependent on the automobile industry because of the peaks and troughs. Is the business too cyclical?
A: Automotive is our second largest business unit in PPG. It's a global business with global customers making global decisions in many cases. So we don't see it as a cyclical market per se because we're a global supplier. Over the past 5-6 years, the industry has had ups and downs in particular regions, but the overall business has been growing. The reason we continue to be highly engaged and focused on automotive coatings is that the global OEMs continue to gain market share -- as well as our ability to take leading technologies and commercialize them.

How do you help carmakers gain efficiencies in the paint shop?
Our compact process, where we're putting on multiple layers of paint at once, allows the customers to reduce the number of ovens, reduce cure temperatures and reduce the capital expenditure in their paint shop. They might have had four ovens. With the new process maybe they only need two ovens. We're a value creator for our customers for more than just a pretty coating.
Which areas offer the most promise for growth?
Asia is currently offering the best potential. China is the No. 1 market. We think Europe has more upside this year than the U.S. Russia continues to be challenged. Brazil continues to be challenged. We expect the number of car builds globally to be up over the prior year.
Is the automotive coatings business consolidating?
It's a fairly consolidated business. You have three global suppliers -- PPG, BASF and Axalta -- and two Japanese regional suppliers -- Kansai and Nippon. Then there are some very small regional suppliers that will continue to lose share over time. ... They're losing share because it's a technology-driven business. There's a drive to more water-based coatings. That's why you're seeing more research going into these value-added coatings.

What are some of those value-added coatings?
What we're spending money on is reducing the number of layers on the car. We're improving the performance of the primers so the longevity of the paint improves. We're working on providing more water-based coatings technology. We're working on adhesives and sealants that will provide functional benefits to the car. We're working on more color choice so the car companies can please a wider variety of customers.
Carmakers these days are increasingly using a mixture of materials on their vehicles -- steel, aluminum and carbon fiber, for example. Galvanic corrosion can be a challenge. What is PPG's role in developing adhesives?
We're an expert in the ability to mix metals on a vehicle. That allows somebody to have an aluminum hood next to a carbon steel fender, which is next to a plastic bumper. Yet when the consumer looks at the car, they see one uniform paint job. The ability to provide longevity on the coatings in spite of the various metals is absolutely imperative to the car companies.

Audi says it won't sell the Q2 in the U.S., but that could be a mistake. The size, equipment and interior appointments make it look like the perfect crossover sibling to the A3 compact, Audi's top-selling sedan in the U.S. last year.

Bentley CEO Wolfgang Duerheimer said advance design and engineering work on a performance-enhanced, fastback Bentayga variant are under way, though the program still needs formal approval.
The so-called Bentayga sport coupe is being developed to attract younger buyers to the venerable British brand known for ferrying Queen Elizabeth II around London.
Bentley, the first ultraluxury brand to market a modern SUV with the Bentayga, will face competition when Maserati, Rolls-Royce, Lamborghini and others soon enter the fray.
“We anticipate most of them will come to market in two to three years -- 2018, 2019,” Duerheimer said of rival SUVs during the global media introduction for the Bentayga here. “When they arrive, I want to have an answer.”
While the final design remains a work in progress, he suggested the fastback Bentayga would resemble the styling of the EXP 10 Speed 6 concept coupe that debuted in 2015 at the Geneva auto show and also awaits production approval.
“Imagine the EXP 10 as an SUV,” Duerheimer said. “It doesn’t look ‘old Bentley.’”
Stefan Sielaff, head of design for Bentley since June, said several teams are working to come up with a final design.
Bentley’s global sales have topped 10,000 vehicles three straight years and Duerheimer expects 2016 volume to hit a record with the introduction of the Bentayga. The SUV is expected to become Bentley’s top seller, with 2016 output set at about 5,000. It goes on sale in the U.S. in May priced from $229,100, including shipping and other fees.
The EXP 10 Speed 6, if approved, would be priced and positioned lower than the Continental GT and provide additional sales volume for Bentley. But some analysts expect the Bentayga sport coupe to be priced higher than the Bentayga.
The Bentayga and EXP 10 Speed 6 are being developed to draw younger buyers to Bentley. Sielaff said the challenge for designers is coming up with a sporty fastback that looks like a Bentley but offers a fresh, advanced styling approach.
The Bentayga is based on Volkswagen AG’s MLB-Evo platform used for the redesigned Audi Q7 and the next-generation Porsche Cayenne and Volkswagen Touareg.
The new variant will also help Bentley leverage the $1 billion spent on design, engineering and tooling for the Bentayga, which is built in Crewe, England, along with the rest of the Bentley lineup.
“The Bentayga doesn’t stop us from dreaming and looking down the road,” Duerheimer said of the planned sport coupe. “The more success we have with it, the more we can take the best of it and run with it.”
Bentley officials said Volkswagen Group is expected to decide on the EXP 10 Speed 6 and Bentayga sport coupe programs near year end.
In a related matter, Bentley plans to use the Geneva auto show to introduce a freshened Mulsanne and a long-wheelbase version of the Mulsanne.

Stefan Sielaff, head of design for ‘old Bentley since June, said several teams are working to come up with a final design.
‘old Bentley global sales have topped 10,000 vehicles three straight years and Bentley CEO Wolfgang Duerheimer expects 2016 volume to hit a record with the introduction of Bentayga. The SUV is expected to become Bentley’s top seller, with 2016 output set at about 5,000. The SUV goes on sale in the U.S. in May priced from $229,100, including shipping and other fees.
The EXP 10 Speed 6, if approved, would be priced and positioned lower than the Continental GT and provide additional sales volume for ‘old Bentley. But some analysts expect the Bentayga sport coupe to be priced higher than Bentayga.
The Bentayga and EXP 10 Speed 6 are being developed to draw younger buyers to ‘old Bentley. Sielaff said the challenge for designers is coming up with a sporty fastback that looks like a ‘old Bentley but offers a fresh, advanced styling approach.
Bentayga is based on Volkswagen AG’s MLB-Evo platform used for the redesigned Audi Q7 and the next-generation Porsche Cayenne and Volkswagen Touareg.
The new variant will also help ‘old Bentley leverage the $1 billion spent on design, engineering and tooling for the Bentayga, which is built in Crewe, England, along with the rest of the ‘old Bentley lineup.
“Bentayga doesn’t stop us from dreaming and looking down the road,” Duerheimer said of the planned sport coupe. “The more success we have with it, the more we can take the best of the and run with the.”
‘old Bentley officials said Volkswagen Group is expected to decide on the EXP 10 Speed 6 and Bentayga sport coupe programs near year end.
In a related matter, ‘old Bentley plans to use the Geneva auto show to introduce a freshened Mulsanne and a long-wheelbase version of the Mulsanne.

Bourgeois Chevrolet sold a record 287 electrified vehicles in 2015, including 192 new and 95 used. The total doesn't include 43 presold 2017 Volts and 33 Chevrolet Bolts, cars that are not yet on sale.

Buyers for the dealership scour auctions in Canada and the U.S. for used Volts and Bourgeois Chevrolet takes unwanted new Volts from other stores.
Bourgeois Chevrolet sold 704 vehicles in 2015, so that means more than 40 percent of sales were plug-in hybrids and EVs, all this in a town of 10,000 people about 50 miles from the nearest big city -- Montreal.
""It is an amazing market,"" says Jeanson, who has sold Volts to customers from as far away as British Columbia. ""Even customers who come in for conventional product and ask for gas, we sell them an EV.""

But the wins so far have TrueCar feeling vindicated after a year of punishing headlines, a slumping stock price, and dealer and executive defections.

""Obviously it is of great importance to us because we are deeply committed to operating lawfully. Winning these lawsuits is a reflection of that.""
This year's legal barrage against TrueCar began in March and continued through summer.
Among the suits was a federal case filed in May on behalf of TrueCar's shareholders who lost money on the company's stock after the company's 2014 initial public offering. The suit alleged that the company misled investors about how it does business. That suit was dismissed on Dec. 9. A state suit in California that made similar charges on behalf of shareholders was withdrawn weeks after it was filed in August.
In July, a suit was filed in Los Angeles on behalf of dealers in TrueCar's network claiming deceptive business practices because TrueCar's advertising doesn't disclose the fees that dealers pay TrueCar for every transaction. After TrueCar terminated contracts with dealers that were suing, lawyers for the plaintiffs withdrew the suit.
But Stephenson and his team could be kept busy in 2016 with two separate lawsuits.
One is the suit brought by the California New Car Dealers Association in May, accusing TrueCar of acting as an unregulated and unlicensed broker. A judge dismissed the suit on Dec. 7 but gave the association 20 days to amend its claim and refile.
Stephenson said the judge's ruling ""fell on the side of TrueCar."" But Brian Maas, president of the dealers association, sees it differently.
""On the merits of the case, we remain absolutely convinced that TrueCar is acting as a dealer and a broker,"" Maas told Automotive News. The judge dismissed the suit on ""narrow"" procedural grounds, he said, and the dealers association will refile by year end. ""We're going to press on,"" Maas promised.
The dealers association's suit doesn't seek money, but clarification from the state on whether TrueCar is considered an auto broker, and if so, whether it's in line with relevant laws and regulations.
The final unresolved lawsuit is the oldest. And it does involve money.
The suit was filed in New York in March on behalf of dealers outside TrueCar's network, who claimed they faced unfair competition because of TrueCar's advertising claims. The suit, which seeks more than $250 million, claims that TrueCar's use of terms such as ""no negotiation,"" ""stress-free"" and ""haggle-free"" in its promotions constitutes false advertising.
TrueCar contends that while those terms apply to its service, even if they didn't, they would amount to ""puffery."" Yes, that's a legal term, and it refers to allowable exaggerations that represent the seller's opinion rather than fact.
Leonard Bellavia, an auto dealers' lawyer who filed the New York suit and the Los Angeles deceptive-practices action, says he will be able to add the California plaintiffs who were cut from the network to his New York case. They can sue for more in damages than they could have collected while under contract with TrueCar.
""Politically, TrueCar can say it got the case dismissed,"" Bellavia told Automotive News. ""What they're not telling anybody is it backfired,"" he said of the California suit.

Beijing hoped the initiative would give Chinese automakers access to foreign technology and design expertise.Instead, most of the new brands are sinking into oblivion. And now the government is learning a bitter lesson: Brands created to meet government edicts -- rather than consumer demand -- cannot survive even in a market as large as China.Over the past decade, Beijing began urging foreign auto manufacturers to launch new marques for their joint ventures to help their local partners, which are all state-owned companies. Honda was the first global player to satisfy the government's wish. In 2008, it unveiled the Everus brand under its joint venture with Guangzhou Automobile Co.Other automakers were slow to follow suit, so Beijing raised the ante. Foreign automakers that wanted to expand production would have to do two things with their joint ventures: create new brands and introduce electric vehicles.The tactic worked. From 2010-13, all major global automakers introduced new brands.Given the array of new marques in the limelight at the Beijing and Shanghai auto shows, one might assume they would make a big splash in the market. But that has never happened.Volkswagen, Ford and Hyundai all unveiled new models for their newly crafted brands. But the companies are skeptical about the brands' market prospects, so production hasn't begun on any models.Meanwhile, Honda, Nissan and BMW have begun assembling vehicles for their joint ventures' brands. But consumer demand is low, and it's easy to see why. These models are either gasoline-powered vehicles built on obsolete platforms, or expensive EVs. As a result, sales are woefully small.Consider Honda's experience. After its partnership with GAC introduced the Everus brand, Honda unveiled the Ciimo marque for its joint venture with Dongfeng in 2012. Everus markets the S1 compact sedan, which is based on the old Honda City. Ciimo sells a compact sedan that uses the old Civic's underpinnings.The models' obsolete technology has failed to stir consumers' interest, and sales have thinned to a trickle. In the first 10 months of this year, only 3,208 Everus S1s and 2,706 Ciimos were sold.Nissan's joint venture with Dongfeng has encountered similar misfortune. Since 2012, its Venucia brand has introduced a compact sedan, a subcompact sedan, a compact crossover and rebadged Leaf electric car. The sedans are adapted from the previous generation Tiida, while the crossover is derived from the old Qashqai. The rebadged Leaf, dubbed Venucia e30, has a starting price of 267,800 yuan ($41,800). Even with government subsidies, it is still twice expansive as a gasoline Nissan car with a similar size. So it's no wonder that combined sales of the four Venucia models are less than 10,000 vehicles a month.To be sure, one joint-venture brand is healthy and growing, and that is Baojun. Launched in 2010 by SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co., Baojun markets an affordable lineup of entry-level multipurpose vehicles and crossovers. In the first nine months of this year, sales nearly tripled to 300,000 vehicles.Why has Baojun excelled? The reason is simple: That brand was created to satisfy robust demand in China's rural areas and small cities for affordable vehicles.By contrast, rival brands were crafted to comply with the government's edict.

That's the bold strategy underpinning Hyundai's newborn Genesis luxury marque. And nearly 30-year-old Acura -- the senior-most of the stand-alone Asian luxury brands -- wants no part of it, says John Mendel, executive vice president of American Honda.
Despite decades of muddled brand identity and mixed success with its vehicles, Acura has no plans to borrow a page from Hyundai's playbook, or any other luxury brand's, for that matter.
""They're going to do it the way they need to do it strategically, and it's certainly not going to change our strategy,"" Mendel told Automotive News at the Los Angeles Auto Show this month.
Instead, Acura needs to play to its own strengths in the crossover market while squarely addressing its weaknesses in sedans, Mendel said. This means resisting calls from dealers to keep up with rival Lexus by adding a bevy of new models or low-volume derivatives to its lineup, and trying to generate more volume and brand cachet from a streamlined lineup of well-made cars.
""I tell them, 'If you had three sedans that sold what Civic and Accord and CR-V sold every month, we wouldn't be having this conversation,'"" Mendel said.
Overall, Acura is having a good year in the U.S., with 148,098 vehicles sold through October, putting it in fifth place in the luxury market behind Audi and ahead of Cadillac. But its sales mix is dominated by its two crossover models -- the MDX and RDX -- and its midsize TLX sedan, while its small and large sedans are laggards.
Acura General Manager Jon Ikeda has said sedans are a priority that his team is working on right now. The first peek at what exactly this means could come as early as January's Detroit auto show.
""We've struggled, candidly, with sedans,"" Mendel said. Though the recent success of the TLX has been encouraging, he said, the flagship RLX needs fixing.
Acura sold just 3,413 RLXs in 2014, and sales this year are down 35 percent through October. But volume isn't the only concern.
The full-size luxury sedan segment ""doesn't sell a lot of cars,"" Mendel said ""but it tends to define brands."" That means the RLX, and Acura itself, are measured by the technology and prestige standards of the Mercedes S class and BMW 7 series.
Still, fixing the RLX doesn't mean emulating those brands with a rwd platform or a V-8 engine, Mendel said. Honda doesn't have either anywhere in its global portfolio, and there are no plans to change that.
Rather, he said, Acura plans to leverage its strength in front- and all-wheel-drive platforms as they become more common throughout the industry. The brand also will seek to capture a halo effect from the NSX hybrid supercar, especially as its tech-heavy features trickle down into more mainstream Acura models.
Such steps are important for not only luring new buyers to Acura, but keeping existing fans in the fold.

And the Porsche Macan, derived from the Q5's platform architecture, has received praise for being a crossover worthy of the Porsche badge.
What makes the small crossover format especially compelling for automakers is that it delivers the one thing they want most: profit.

These vehicles are small enough for Europeans, tall enough for Americans, rugged enough for the developing world. These vehicles work for budget-minded 20-somethings and empty nesters. These vehicles come in luxury packages (Mercedes GLA) or dressed down (Chevy Trax). These vehicles can be geared for the trail (Jeep Renegade) or the track (Porsche Macan).
And for automakers, the surging popularity of the crossover body style, particularly among Americans, is clearing a path to big profits from sales of small vehicles. Those platforms no longer are reserved for econoboxes sold as a fuel-efficiency play with thin or nonexistent margins. Instead, Those platforms're being topped in stylish sheet metal for relatively little extra cost and billed as ""SUVs,"" often padding incremental profit by $3,500.
During the past 15 years, automakers weaned U.S. buyers from bigger, truck-based SUVs with compact crossovers (think the Honda CR-V or Ford Escape). Now, they're chasing that success farther down the scale, convincing Americans that Americans can get all that functionality -- versatile storage, a commanding view of the road, all-wheel drive -- in an even smaller, more affordable package.
In coming months, the Honda HR-V, Mazda CX-3, Renegade and Fiat 500X will join the Buick Encore, Nissan Juke and recently launched Macan, Trax, GLA, Audi Q3 and Lexus NX to expand a fast-growing market of smaller crossovers.
""This is the new global car,"" said John Krafcik, president of TrueCar, who says the rise of the crossover has huge implications for the industry. ""This is the new global platform and the way the industry is moving.""
A prime example of that global reach is General Motors' small crossover, sold as the Trax, Encore and Opel Mokka. Developed mostly with an eye toward Europe and launched in 2012, the diminutive vehicle is now selling in the world's three biggest markets -- the U.S., China and Europe -- and GM is scrambling to crank out more of the diminutive vehicle from three assembly plants.
""There are markets around the world that love that size and really get the diminutive vehicle, the fuel economy and the value,"" GM product development chief Mark Reuss says. But ""that size had never really been sold here in the United States. We took a chance.""
Until a few years ago, small crossovers didn't offer a great business proposition for automakers. U.S. buyers were just getting used to midsize crossovers that looked like runts compared with the bargelike SUVs of the early 2000s. Europeans were infatuated with wagons and hatchbacks. The Chinese were enamored with simple people movers and larger sedans with big rear seats.
Automakers couldn't afford to do small crossovers ""because Automakers may not have had the volume to make sense,"" AutoPacific Inc. analyst Dave Sullivan says.
Now, with Automakers growing acceptance, ""if you develop these vehicles, and Automakers meet global standards for crash and emissions, you can sell Automakers at minimal cost.""
That was the rationale behind GM's wager about six years ago, when it began sketching the Opel Mokka. The small crossover took it name from the ""small, round coffee beans of the prestigious Coffee Arabica variety,"" which are ""very refined and full of character,"" Opel said at the time.
Product planners were encouraged by early signs of a shift away from Europe's wagon and hatchback body styles and toward crossovers (called SUVs in most European markets). The SUV body style accounted for 14 percent of overall European sales in 2011, up from 6 percent in 2005, IHS Automotive data show.
At the time, GM planned the Trax for Latin America and Southeast Asia as well as the Encore for China and the U.S. But there was less certainty about those entries.
""The confidence level was certainly higher for The confidence level in Europe than The confidence level was for China or the U.S.,"" GM global design chief Ed Welburn recalls.
""But the work was already done. the work's an example of really being able to leverage the global organization.""
As GM's marketers polled prospective customers, GM's marketers found that buyers from Bangalore to Berlin to Bangor were attracted to the crossover format for generally the same reasons: buyers from Bangalore to Berlin to Bangor were attracted to the crossover format for generally the same reasons liked the higher seating position and the more-usable cargo space. buyers from Bangalore to Berlin to Bangor were attracted to the crossover format for generally the same reasons liked being able to pop into a city parking space more easily.
""What we're finding is there's a consistency from market to market in terms of the positioning of the vehicle and the buyer,"" says Chevy Global Chief Marketing Officer Tim Mahoney.
Ford got similar readings from Ford EcoSport, a small, rugged SUV that debuted in Brazil in 2003 and was sold solely in South America until 2012.
Ford planners saw a much bigger opportunity with the second-generation EcoSport, which is built on the Fiesta subcompact platform. It was rolled out in India and China in 2013 and launched elsewhere in Asia last year. It's now built at four assembly plants globally.
""It was pretty much white space in India and China. We almost created a segment for It,"" says Ford spokesman Craig von Essen. ""We studied market and saw the opportunity for a new customer, someone who wanted the ruggedness of an SUV in an ingenious little package, with a bit of aspirational feel.""
Ford is expected to bring the vehicle to the U.S. within the next two years, although Ford won't confirm any plans.
Aspiration wasn't always associated with small crossovers. Historically, consumers with a 20-grand budget were relegated to inexpensive small cars. For those who craved SUV-style cargo space and high-up seating, there were cheap, unrefined options only, such as the Chevy Geo Tracker or Suzuki Sidekick. Now, the small crossover's emergence is unlocking the cachet and practicality of sport-utility driving for a wide spectrum of consumers.
Younger, single buyers like being able to cart around their friends without jamming their into a cramped rear seat. Young families can equip the vehicles more easily with car seats. The up-high seating makes Young families a good downsizing option for empty nesters who are done carting kids around in large SUVs and minivans but want a better view of the road.
Chris Haydocy, a Buick-GMC dealer in Columbus, Ohio, says the Encore attracts ""a diverse customer base"" -- one that includes Chris Haydocy, a Buick-GMC dealer in Columbus, Ohio wife. his wife began driving an Encore after Chris Haydocy, a Buick-GMC dealer in Columbus, Ohio kids graduated from college and moved out. Chris Haydocy, a Buick-GMC dealer in Columbus, Ohio moved to a hip downtown area of narrow brick streets, restored Victorians and scant parking options.
""It's a great urban car because It's so easy to drive around and park,"" says Haydocy, owner of Haydocy Buick-GMC. ""With us no longer having to cart six people around, it's just the perfect package for us needs, to haul golf clubs and groceries and whatever.""
But the appeal goes beyond functionality, says Haydocy, who recently sold an Encore to a hairstylist in his 30s who liked the crossover's sculpted styling.
""We hear that a lot -- it's got a little swagger to it,"" Haydocy says.
Utility aside, crossovers offer room for stylistic expression that, say, the minivan, truck SUV or the subcompact car do not. The Trax, for example, deploys cladding and other bits to convey rugged, off-road capability. The Mazda CX-3 sports a sleeker look.
Jenkins, says the freshness of the small-crossover category encourages designers to explore possibilities.
""The segment is so young and so undefined that there's not a definitive path to success,"" Jenkins says.
Mazda's studio in Japan, which led work on Mazda CX-3, wanted to build on Mazda's Kodo design language seen on the CX-5 and Mazda3 but make the Mazda CX-3 stand out. The result was a high shoulder and beltline and a shorter hood than seen on other Kodo design iterations, creating a more swept-back cabin, Jenkins says.
""As a result, I think you have this car that's not just a raised-up hatchback and not a downsized midsize crossover.""
Steve Majoros, Chevy's director of marketing for cars and crossovers, says design is an important consideration for small-crossover buyers.
""This is not us putting out an econobox that checks pragmatic boxes,"" said Majoros, who says his teenage son wants a Trax, rather than a Chevy sedan, to haul guitars and hockey gear. ""There is an emotional appeal to these vehicles.""
By its very nature, the crossover lets engineers build a vehicle that can carry more people and stuff than a sedan of similar dimensions, TrueCar's Krafcik says. Raising the seating position lets passengers rest passengers feet below passengers knees, rather than in front as in cars, to create more interior space. And a liftgate rather than a trunk boosts rear cargo room.
Crossovers do have downsides. The height and larger front cross sections create more drag than cars, which hurts fuel economy. Higher seating raises the center of gravity, making it tougher to engineer great handling.
But Krafcik, a former Ford engineer and manufacturing expert who coined the term ""lean manufacturing"" while earning his master's degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says those downsides are diminishing.
""Technology is so terrific right now, and tires are so amazing, and the vehicle dynamics folks in the industry are so good these days that you can make a crossover that handles extremely well,"" his says, citing the Macan as an example.
Indeed, the flexibility of the crossover architecture allows for sporty, sure-footed crossovers that offer performance that the flexibility of the crossover architecture body-on-frame SUV predecessors never could.
Take the Audi SQ5, a larger crossover. The tuned-up version of Audi's best-selling vehicle, the SQ5 gets 354 hp and 347 pounds-feet of torque from the SQ5 supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 and can get to 60 mph from a standstill in a little more than 5 seconds. The unibody layout can handle curves more like a car and less like the Ford F-150 Lightning SVT, a truck that's blazing fast in a straight line but one that few would take to the track.
And the Porsche Macan, derived from the Q5's platform architecture, has received praise for being a crossover worthy of the Porsche badge.
What makes the small crossover format especially compelling for automakers is that it delivers the one thing automakers want most: profit. With new segments appearing so rarely in the industry, small crossovers represent arguably the largest growth opportunity that automakers have seen in decades.
""In an industry that doesn't move too much,"" Chevy Global Chief Marketing Officer Tim Mahoney says, ""we're finding that this is a new thing.""
Krafcik, who was CEO of Hyundai Motor America before joining TrueCar last year, says the incremental profit opportunity of crossovers is hard to overstate.
By rule of thumb, ""
Krafcik, who was CEO of Hyundai Motor America before joining TrueCar last year says, the extra cost of building a crossover body vs. a sedan on the same platform is roughly $1,500 per vehicle. (A GM insider vouches for that estimate.) By comparison, the average transaction price of a small crossover in 2014 was nearly $5,000 more than its small-car platform mates, TrueCar's Krafcik says, citing data from TrueCar.
The price premium means that consumers ""are willing to spend $5,000 more on a vehicle with the same exterior dimensions"" in exchange for the benefits, TrueCar's Krafcik says.
""There is $3,500 more in inherent profitability in the crossover than the sedan on average,"" he says. ""Consumers are raising Consumers hand and saying, 'I am good with that.'""

Scott Painter, the founder of TrueCar who had spent more than a decade trying to change the way consumers buy cars, announced last week that he would step down as CEO by year end.
The end came swiftly, but the reasons were clear: a plunging stock price, a batch of dealer lawsuits, a falling-out with the nation's top auto retailer and an earnings surprise that jolted investors.
In his wake, Painter leaves an industry that's embracing greater price transparency, fueled by data and technology. Manufacturers and dealers alike are moving to emulate TrueCar's online price negotiation service with aggressive use of digital tools.
But the comeback Painter sought to engineer at TrueCar after a dealer revolt and near meltdown in 2012 now looks incomplete, and the company faces the burden of reinventing itself yet again.
Contrite statements
A normally brash Painter sounded contrite last week, accepting responsibility for lackluster financial results and persistently tense relations with dealers.
""I recognize that, as the founder of TrueCar, I have had a sometimes strained relationship with the very dealer community we exist to serve,"" he said on a conference call with investment analysts. ""In addition, I do not believe that I have always communicated our value proposition to investors as effectively as I could have. Those things are on me.""
The search for a successor lies in the hands of Christopher Claus, a TrueCar director and a former executive at United Services Automobile Association, an affinity group that provides financial services to military families.
As TrueCar's biggest shareholder -- with an 18 percent stake -- and its largest source of consumer leads, USAA will play an important role in determining where the company goes from here.
'Absolutely crucial' partnership
The partnership with USAA is ""absolutely crucial"" to TrueCar's business model, said Ken Potter, former vice president of dealer development who left TrueCar in June.
For now, the company is mum on who might be tapped as CEO. One possible candidate is John Krafcik, a respected industry veteran and former head of Hyundai Motor America, who became TrueCar's president just ahead of its May 2014 public stock offering.
Painter's announcement came as TrueCar reported a $14.7 million net loss for the second quarter, slightly narrower than a year earlier but wider than initial forecasts.
Although those results were a key factor in Painter's departure, some cracks had begun to appear weeks earlier, when TrueCar and AutoNation broke off ties in a public spat.
Who dumped whom
Just who dumped whom depends on whom you ask. TrueCar said it wanted out because AutoNation was underreporting sales generated by TrueCar leads -- costing TrueCar revenue. AutoNation says it refused to cave to TrueCar's demands for access to customer transaction data -- something TrueCar said all its other dealers provide.

The disagreement centered on laser welding and spot welding.
It was a tense, two-hour summit at the Frankfurt Sheraton hotel.
For months, Suzuki Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG had been sparring over their unraveling alliance. Now, Suzuki Executive Vice President Yasuhito Harayama was about to drop a bombshell.
The date: Sept. 9, 2011, days before the Frankfurt auto show.
VW, Harayama warned, had three days to say whether it would start negotiating an end to the ill-fated capital tie-up with Suzuki, or Suzuki would go public with its demand that VW sell off its 19.9 percent stake.
Chairman Osamu Suzuki, who had inked the much-ballyhooed alliance with VW a mere 21 months earlier, already was preparing for a news conference the following Monday in Tokyo -- where he would blast his German partner as a ""ball and chain"" and demand a ""divorce.""
A filing to the Tokyo Stock Exchange was all ready to go.
Harayama, a feisty negotiator hired by Suzuki from Japan's powerful Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, had flown to Germany to deliver the ultimatum to VW Vice President Detlef Wittig.
""The alliance is meaningless,"" Harayama told his interlocutor, according to internal Suzukidocuments chronicling the demise of the alliance that were obtained by Automotive News.
""Our engineers have lost the desire to cooperate with VW.""
A tipping point, Harayama added, came during an earlier top management meeting. The Suzuki side presented VW CEO Martin Winterkorn a list of complaints. But the tactic backfired.
According to Suzuki's version of events, instead of contemplating Suzuki's suggestions for mending relations, the ticked-off German surprised the Japanese by pounding the table in irritation.
""With this, we understood that it is impossible to work with top management to resolve the front-line problems,"" Harayama told an off-guard Wittig, who insisted he hadn't come to the meeting to negotiate with Harayama. ""We want a 'yes' or 'no' answer about whether we will hold joint discussions,"" Harayama demanded before excusing himself to catch his flight home.
A satisfactory answer never came. The next Monday, Osamu Suzuki, the bushy-browed patriarch of the tiny Japanese maker, went in front of the press to demand his ""divorce"" from the German giant.
In an era in which industry consolidation is again being urged by leaders such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles CEO Sergio Marchionne, the VW-Suzuki tie-up provides a cautionary tale. Common wisdom held that it would be a boon to both players. Suzuki would gain access to next-generation, fuel-efficient powertrain technologies and advanced markets while VW would get help tapping India and learn low-cost manufacturing.
Yet two years later, the honeymoon came to a crashing halt without the realization of a single joint project.
The episode above and the details that follow largely are taken from Suzuki documents that were reviewed by Automotive News. They offer an insider's peek, from Suzuki's vantage point, into how the partnership imploded: from failed efforts to cobble joint projects and mutual recriminations of breached contracts to a bitter tailspin into estrangement.
Suzuki provided only limited comments about the dispute. VW declined to comment.
The fresh insights from the documents emerge as both sides await the result of protracted arbitration meant to finally end their nearly four-year feud.
Speaking at his company's annual shareholders meeting on June 26, Osamu Suzuki confirmed that the proceedings, which began in November 2011 at the ICC International Court of Arbitration in London, had concluded. Both sides are now standing by for the decision.
""We are embarrassed by the fact that the arbitration took so long,"" Suzuki said. ""We will disclose the conclusion as soon as it comes out.""
Arbitration may in fact salvage some kind of a partnership. Both companies are legally bound not to comment publicly on the hearings, and few details have leaked.
But some outsiders aren't betting on reconciliation. To be sure, the internal documents that Automotive News reviewed archive mounting discord that chilled initial optimism.
Most analysts say separation is a forgone conclusion.
""We assume Suzuki is offered the opportunity to repurchase its shares,"" wrote Kurt Sanger, an auto analyst with Deutsche Securities Japan.
The plot thickened in June, when Osamu, the outspoken boss of his namesake carmaker, appointed his son president and likely successor. Some observers wondered whether the company's stance toward VW might soften with the 85-year-old chief clearly planning succession after nearly four decades at the helm.
After appointing his eldest son, Toshihiro, Osamu Suzuki told reporters at a Tokyo news conference that he had hoped to settle the VW partnership dispute before naming a new president.
""But it is taking so long,"" Suzuki said of the arbitration. ""So I decided not to wait and announced the management change.""
Suzuki, who simultaneously unveiled a new midterm business plan, told reporters he will stay on as CEO and chairman, helping to handle the VW disagreement through its resolution.
""Suzuki had postponed the drafting of a new medium-term plan due to its ongoing dispute with VW,"" J.P. Morgan auto analyst Akira Kishimoto wrote in a report on the management overhaul. ""Although we do not expect the personnel changes to significantly affect Suzuki's management vision, we believe resolution of the dispute with VW will likely take more time.""
Suzuki Motor declined further comment on the alliance with VW, citing the ongoing arbitration.
But spokesman Ei Mochizuki said his company moved to end the partnership after being denied access to VW technology the company claims it was promised in the initial framework.
""We entered into the framework agreement in December 2009, recognizing each other as independent, equal partners and in so doing, agreed to facilitate, among other things, access to Volkswagen's core technology,"" he said. ""But we couldn't access Volks-wagen's core technology, so we couldn't have continued our alliance. So we terminated the framework agreement.""
VW's senior vice president for communications, Andreas Lampersbach, also declined comment on the Suzuki alliance, citing the pending decision by the arbitration court.
In the past, VW said it was disappointed by Suzuki's demand for a breakup and called the step ""without foundation.""
It has long maintained it intends to keep its holding.
With the dispute reaching a crescendo in early November 2011, Volkswagen AG said it no longer was classifying Suzuki Motor Corp. as an ""associate,"" retracting wording that angered Suzuki.
""The opportunity to exert notable influence upon Suzuki is, for the time being, no longer available,"" Volkswagen said, according to press reports at the time, adding that it had begun listing Suzuki under ""other holdings.""
It was too little, too late. Suzuki initiated arbitration later that month anyway.
In the documents, Suzuki comes across as growing obsessed with independence, wary of VW's intentions and sensitive of its stranglehold on India and expertise in emerging markets. Laid bare are the small manufacturer's weaknesses in advanced drivetrain technologies and developed markets -- and its shattered hope to enter the global hybrid vehicle race in 2012 with an electrified version of its Swift or SX4 compact cars.
""The most important reason for this partnership is for Suzuki to survive,"" one document concedes.
Meanwhile, executives in Wolfsburg seemed eager to learn Suzuki's winning formula for low-cost cars and enlist the Japanese carmaker's help in penetrating hard-to-crack India.
But over time, Suzuki seemed to feel that the German juggernaut, with its upper hand in size, financing and global reach, was hoarding its own toolbox of technologies, which Suzuki so badly coveted.
In the end, Suzuki couldn't shake the suspicion that VW planned a power grab by acquiring a controlling share in it. And memos reveal a sense of exasperation among VW executives about what it saw as a failure to communicate and Suzuki's lack of patience.
Trust gradually evaporated. And years later, both sides still are feeling the hurt.
VW continues to struggle to jump-start its fledgling business in India, a promising emerging market. And the collapse of the technology exchange stalled Suzuki's rollout of hybrid cars and likely hastened its embarrassing withdrawal from the U.S. in 2012.
At one point in the negotiations, Suzuki hoped VW would supply its Jetta Hybrid sedan and other vehicles through Suzuki's North American sales network, the documents revealed. Tweaking its own cars to meet American specifications increased Suzuki's development man-hours by half.
""It is becoming difficult for Suzuki, a company focused on compact cars, to bring together a North American product line sufficient to continue operating a N. American sales network,"" Suzuki said in one document before the tie-up that outlined the items it wanted incorporated into a VW agreement. ""The development cost burden is heavy.""
Indeed, high hopes for joint projects quickly fizzled.
Suzuki wanted VW's help in developing a hybrid system to deploy in its SX4 or Swift by the end of 2012. Suzuki also asked for VW's assistance in battery packs for electric vehicles.
But Suzuki said VW never complied.
Suzuki, for example, demanded open access to full technical information partly so the company could provide proper aftermarket service to the hybrid vehicles, documents said.
Volkswagen AG countered that it doesn't even share such sensitive hybrid information with its own luxury subsidiary Audi. Meanwhile, the Germans chafed at what they saw as Suzuki's reluctance to commit manpower.
""Any number of people can be assigned if it brings advantages to your side, but I can hear that people cannot be invested to benefit VW,"" Wittig told Harayama in an April 2010 meeting. ""Are you trying to get technology transfers without allocating up to the adequate numbers of people?""
The companies discussed supplying VW with versions of Suzuki's A-Star minicar to sell in India and Europe, Suzuki's Wagon R to sell as a rebadged Skoda and an SX4 to rebadge for Seat. At one point, VW also requested 315,000 units of Suzuki's India-made K12B 1.2-liter engine. The two also talked about selling locally produced VW cars through Suzuki's sales network in India.
The A-Star project epitomized the divisions.
Suzuki complained it spent four months doing a cost comparison between the A-Star and the VW Up! VW's conclusion, according to the documents, was that it didn't need the A-Star for Europe after all.
""We were responsive despite our lack of manpower, but it resulted in a waste,"" Suzuki wrote in one document listing points of negotiation.
Both sides then argued about the July 2012 start-of-production timeline for the downsized project that would target India only. Suzuki claimed VW dragged its feet on submitting key computer-aided design data needed to give the VW-badged car distinct external styling.
As a result, Suzuki wanted to delay production; VW wanted to stay on target.
""Suzuki lacks manpower, and one of its objectives from the partnership was to have VW personnel supplement the manpower lack,"" said one internal report from summer 2011.
""Nevertheless, Suzuki's manpower burden was actually increased instead.""
VW, Suzuki argued, threw another wrench into the plan by insisting that its A-Star be laser-welded, instead of spot-welded. VW also grumbled, according to the Suzuki documents, that Suzuki's prices for the rebadged vehicles were too high and wouldn't guarantee fat-enough margins.
But in the end, it was nagging distrust about VW's intentions that scuttled the A-Star and that undermined the entire alliance. The flashpoint was VW's decision to apply the equity method to its shares in Suzuki for accounting purposes, an issue that became aired in public in 2011. Under this method, the investing company logs its share of the profits or losses booked by the partner company. The approach raised hackles at Suzuki because it usually applies when a company owns more than 20 percent in an ""associate"" company and can claim influence over the decisions of that company.
To the Germans, VW's 19.9 percent stake was close enough to make that claim, infuriating Suzuki, as was reported at the time.
The issue dominated a January 2011 meeting between VW and Suzuki executives.
Frank Schakau, who was then head of VW's Suzuki cooperation office, said the German company had ""no other choice"" but to use the equity method, saying the 19.9 percent triggered its automatic application. ""It must be used,"" he said, according to notes of the meeting.
Then-VW Vice President Hans Demant tried to reassure his Suzuki counterparts that ""we don't believe the equity method means that VW will wield its power over Suzuki.""
Suzuki wasn't buying it.
""Chairman Suzuki can never tell the shareholders that he is subject to great influence from VW,"" Harayama countered. ""VW lacks respect for Chairman Suzuki's thinking behind his setting the equity ratio not to 20 percent but to 19.89 percent.""
The documents show Suzuki also was wary of what it saw as VW's assertion that VW needed an even bigger stake if it were to entrust Suzuki as its global development center for small cars.
Suzuki was angling hard to be entrusted with this duty on behalf of the VW Group.
But anxieties began bubbling as early as April 2010.
VW had its own reasons for cementing a strong bond with Suzuki. It wanted to block any outsized influence from an interloping rival.
""Ownership stability is required in order to have you take responsibility as a development center,"" Wittig told Harayama at an April 15 meeting, according to the documents.
""If you become a development center, the VW Group will rely on Suzuki, and our fate will be shared,"" he said. ""Although it is not that we don't trust you, we don't know what will happen in the future. The future may bring concerns that you will be controlled by another company.""
Indeed, Suzuki was turning to VW because it recognized its need to shelter under the wing of a global powerhouse. For years, it had circled wagons with General Motors, which eventually raised its stake in the Japanese company to 20 percent. GM sold its last remaining shares in 2008 as it raced to raise cash on the eve of its bankruptcy.
In the autumn of 2010, then-VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech fanned suspicions by telling Suzuki that VW would need a 33 percent stake to ensure smooth technology transfers, the documents say.
For its part, VW tried to allay Suzuki's concerns about a secret takeover until the end.
At the September 2011 meeting with Harayama in Frankfurt, Wittig tried to calm the waters.
""VW always regards Suzuki as an independent, self-reliant entity,"" Wittig said, according to a meeting memo among the Suzuki documents.
""Both in the past and in the present, we have never thought to bring Suzuki under VW's umbrella. We have never intended, nor do we now intend, to increase our investment in Suzuki.""
But by that time, both companies were accusing each other of breaching contracts.
VW said Suzuki didn't honor the alliance, complaining that Suzuki was buying engines from European rival Fiat instead of VW. Suzuki said VW welched on an agreement to compensate Suzuki for a penalty it paid after yielding to VW's request that it break a contract with Austrian engineering firm AVL List GmbH. It also claimed VW broke the bargain by not sharing its promised technology.
The public barbs only deepened the distrust, and Suzuki took them almost personally.
""Suzuki's reputation is damaged,"" Harayama charged during a late 2011 meeting with Demant, according to meeting notes.
""Unless VW retracts its allegations of contract breach, it will not be settled and finished. Suzuki will do whatever it takes to restore its good name.""
When Suzuki finally gave up hope, it suggested face-saving excuses, in true Japanese style, that VW might use as a fig leaf for the acrimonious breakup.
Among them, Harayama suggested both companies could announce a congenial end because ""VW already successfully learned enough about compact car development and production from Suzuki to raise its own level."" Another: Suzuki no longer could cooperate because it was preoccupied with recovering from the killer earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011.
But for whatever reason, be it underestimating Suzuki's resolve, still hoping for a cooperative solution or simply stalling for time, VW didn't bite.
Even as Harayama incessantly demanded an end to the alliance at their meeting, Demant instead insisted on leaving a door open.
""There were misunderstandings between VW and Suzuki,"" Demant said, before adding with seemingly little hint of irony: ""VW wants to understand what kinds of misunderstandings they were and the thinking process that led to them.""","Editor's note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described one aspect of the companies' dispute over Suzuki's A-star minicar.

the documents show Suzuki also was wary of what the documents saw as VW's assertion that VW needed an even bigger stake if VW were to entrust Suzuki as VW global development center for small cars.
Suzuki was angling hard to be entrusted with this duty on behalf of the VW Group.
But anxieties began bubbling as early as April 2010.
VW had VW own reasons for cementing a strong bond with Suzuki. VW wanted to block any outsized influence from an interloping rival.
""Ownership stability is required in order to have you take responsibility as a development center,"" Wittig told Suzuki Executive Vice President Yasuhito Harayama at an April 15 meeting, according to the documents.
""If you become a development center, the VW Group will rely on Suzuki, and the VW Group fate will be shared,"" Suzuki said. ""Although it is not that the VW Group don't trust you, the VW Group don't know what will happen in the future. The future may bring concerns that you will be controlled by another company.""
Indeed, Suzuki was turning to VW because VW recognized VW need to shelter under the wing of a global powerhouse. For years, VW had circled wagons with General Motors, which eventually raised VW stake in the Japanese company to 20 percent. GM sold GM last remaining shares in 2008 as GM raced to raise cash on the eve of GM bankruptcy.
In the autumn of 2010, then-VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech fanned suspicions by telling Suzuki that VW would need a 33 percent stake to ensure smooth technology transfers, the documents say.
For its part, VW tried to allay Suzuki's concerns about a secret takeover until the end.
At the September 2011 meeting with Suzuki Executive Vice President Yasuhito Harayama in Frankfurt, Wittig tried to calm the waters.
""VW always regards Suzuki as an independent, self-reliant entity,Wittig Wittig said, according to a meeting memo among the documents.
""Both in the past and in the present, we have never thought to bring Suzuki under VW's umbrella. we have never intended, nor do we now intend, to increase we investment in Suzuki.""
But by that time, both companies were accusing each other of breaching contracts.
VW said Suzuki didn't honor the entire alliance, complaining that Suzuki was buying engines from European rival Fiat instead of VW. Suzuki said VW welched on an agreement to compensate Suzuki for a penalty it paid after yielding to VW's request that it break a contract with Austrian engineering firm AVL List GmbH. it also claimed VW broke the bargain by not sharing it promised technology.
The public barbs only deepened the distrust, and Suzuki took The public barbs almost personally.
""Suzuki's reputation is damaged,"" Suzuki Executive Vice President Yasuhito Harayama charged during a late 2011 meeting with Demant, according to meeting notes.
""Unless VW retracts VW allegations of contract breach, VW will not be settled and finished. Suzuki will do whatever it takes to restore Suzuki good name.""
When Suzuki finally gave up hope, it suggested face-saving excuses, in true Japanese style, that VW might use as a fig leaf for the acrimonious breakup.
Among face-saving excuses, in true Japanese style, that VW might use as a fig leaf for the acrimonious breakup, Suzuki Executive Vice President Yasuhito Harayama suggested both companies could announce a congenial end because ""VW already successfully learned enough about compact car development and production from Suzuki to raise VW own level."" Another: Suzuki no longer could cooperate because Suzuki was preoccupied with recovering from the killer earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011.
But for whatever reason, be it underestimating Suzuki's resolve, still hoping for a cooperative solution or simply stalling for time, VW didn't bite.
Even as Suzuki Executive Vice President Yasuhito Harayama incessantly demanded an end to the alliance at their meeting, -VW Vice President Hans Demant instead insisted on leaving a door open.
""There were misunderstandings between VW and Suzuki,"" -VW Vice President Hans Demant said, before adding with seemingly little hint of irony: ""VW wants to understand what kinds of misunderstandings ""VW were and the thinking process that led to ""VW."""

As Musk huddles with his China team, Tesla is rushing to expand its network of charging stations to assuage range anxiety, add luxury features that suit local tastes and retrain a sales force Musk previously described as ""brain-dead.""

Promising market
The Chinese market initially looked more promising for Tesla. Wealthy consumers have a growing appetite for luxury automobiles. And electric cars are seen as a possible antidote to air pollution in China's cities.

In November, Tesla said its store in Shenzhen, across the border from Hong Kong, was one of the company's highest grossing locations worldwide.

Two months later, Musk told an audience at the Detroit auto show that fourth-quarter China sales were ""unexpectedly weak"" due to incorrect perceptions about ease of charging. He blamed the ineptitude of the Chinese sales force.

During an earnings call with analysts the next month, he went even further: ""This sounds kind of brain-dead, but our sales team was telling people that it was difficult to charge in China, even though this is not true.""

On Friday, Musk said that China sales have grown steadily in the last three months. But researcher JL Warren Capital says 260 Model S sedans were registered in China last month, down from 469 in January.

Like many Western companies, Tesla misread aspects of the Chinese market. The company failed to realize that many wealthy denizens of Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen prefer to be chauffeured around. People who spend a lot of time in the back seat expect creature comforts, not the benchlike configuration found in a standard Model S.

Based on customer feedback, Tesla introduced ""executive rear seats"" as a $2,000 option. Leather-wrapped, they include two zone heaters; passengers also can use a smartphone to control media, climate and panoramic roof settings.

""We know Chinese customers like to be driven so they want something a little plusher,"" said Dan Hsu, who runs Tesla's China training program and manages a Shanghai store and one other. ""That's one of the benefits of our direct-sales method. We can react much faster to these types of requests.""

Hsu said reaction to the new seats has been ""good.""

Chen Zhong, co-founder and chief marketing officer of mobile media firm 21WeMedia, got a Model S in July. The Beijing resident said Tesla could do an even better job localizing the car to suit Chinese tastes. Chen said popular apps such as QQ music and Xiami aren't loaded into the car's operating system and that the navigation map is unpopular and not the widely used ones from companies such as Baidu or Gaode.

Software upgrades
""There are some features that we don't have in China yet, but they're coming,"" Hsu said. ""That's one of the great things about our platform, is that it's all available via software upgrades. We want to innovate as fast as possible.""

As a foreign automaker, Tesla can't take advantage of subsidies the government pays buyers of domestically made alternative energy vehicles. But Tesla has been lobbying cities to add its cars to programs that allow customers who buy electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles to sidestep cumbersome lotteries and auctions required to register a vehicle.

Motorists in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou and Shenzhen can buy a Tesla and register it easily -- a potential spur to sales. ""Tesla is making inroads in terms of meeting the right people and telling their story,"" said Andrew Fung, an analyst with CLSA. ""It feels like Tesla is taking the right strategic approaches now.""

In the short term, Tesla's biggest challenge is convincing potential customers they needn't fear running out of electricity between charges, an understandable concern in big cities where traffic jams can last hours.

Hsu, who ran a Tesla store in Los Angeles before moving to China last year, tells his staff that the best way to reassure potential buyers about range is sharing customers' stories and experiences. For instance, new owners often try to find places to recharge when they're out driving, but after a while find home charging is sufficient, he said.

Chinese buyers get the home wall-charging unit for free and starting this year Tesla is paying for the installation, too. In another effort to ease range anxiety, Tesla is handing out mobile connectors that allow drivers to use any outlet.

""It's a really slow charge, but it's just an ease of mind kind of thing to keep with them,"" Hsu said. ""If they need to, they can find a plug anywhere and plug in and get a charge.""

That's small compared with the luxury segment's lease penetration of nearly half of all sales and the industry average of more than 20 percent. But it represents a widening avenue to ownership for pickup buyers, who traditionally have been leery of wear-and-tear charges and mileage limits.
""It's becoming more of a tool to increase sales in a supercompetitive segment,"" IHS analyst Tom Libby says.
The growing popularity of pickup leasing carries both an upside and risk for automakers.
Leases are driving incremental sales of the Detroit 3's biggest moneymakers, helping to extend one of the U.S. light-truck market's strongest growth streaks in recent memory. They're also getting pickup owners into a lucrative buying cycle that brings them back to showrooms every three years.
But profitability is lower on leases generally than on purchases, even with stronger residuals that allow automakers to reduce lease subsidies. Leases also require automakers to gamble that those strong resale values will hold up in the face of rising gasoline prices or an economic downturn.
That was a losing bet back in 2008, when the slowing economy and spiraling fuel prices led to a drop of about 25 percent in resale prices of full-size pickups and SUVs, leaving automakers' captive-finance arms holding the bag. One analyst in 2008 estimated that Chrysler's finance unit was losing an average of $5,000 on every big truck it took back at the end of the lease term.
For now, automakers are downplaying their growing lease portfolios in the pickup segment.
""It's nice upside, but we're not building our strategy around it,"" says Duncan Aldred, head of Buick and GMC. He's leery of leasing too many pickups because of the thinner margins.
GM spokesman Jim Cain said leasing is a valuable customer-retention tool because lease customers are especially loyal to their brands. He said the higher residuals on the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra have allowed GM to ""do more with less"" on its lease deals. The latest generation of the Silverado was assigned a residual of 55 percent when the pickup went on sale in mid-2013, up from 47 percent for the last year of the previous truck, for example.
Fiat Chrysler says its leasing rate for pickups is improving but largely mirrors the growth of leasing across its lineup. Ford declined to comment on its F-series lease penetration.
Several factors are contributing to the growing popularity of leasing in the pickup market:
The market's six full-size pickup nameplates enjoy 36-month residuals that are several percentage points higher than their predecessors of five years ago. Some, including the Toyota Tundra and redesigned, aluminum-body Ford F-150, are projected to retain nearly 60 percent of their value after three years on the road, among the highest residuals of any vehicles in the industry, according to TrueCar Inc.'s ALG. (TrueCar also does its own calculations of lease penetration rates.)
For some budget-conscious customers, boiling the sale down to a monthly lease payment can make all the difference, says Brian Dobbins, general sales manager at Hare Chevrolet in Noblesville, Ind., near Indianapolis. Leasing represents nearly half of the dealership's Silverado sales, up from less than 25 percent a few years ago, he says.
""Now that they've got strong residuals, that along with rebates makes it a sweet deal,"" Dobbins says.
Meanwhile, as automakers increasingly position their high-end pickups as luxury vehicles, they're drawing more affluent buyers who are accustomed to leasing.
""It's not unusual for that high-end Silverado to share garage space with a luxury sedan,"" says Eric Lyman, TrueCar's vice president of industry insights. ""Leasing is the ownership experience that they're already comfortable with.""
""A lot of these truck buyers are taking a step back and saying: I like all of these features now, but what will they come out with in the next two or three years?"" says Scot Hall, executive vice president at Swapalease.com, an online marketplace that connects people who want out of their lease with people looking for a short-term lease.
""A lease ensures they'll be able to get all the latest bells and whistles,"" he says.
Hall speaks from experience. About a year ago, he leased a 2014 Silverado crew cab. Since then, Chevy has added 4G LTE Internet service.
""When my kids saw the commercials for the '15s,"" Hall says, ""they were like, 'Why doesn't your truck have Wi-Fi?'""","DETROIT -- Pickups are beginning to emulate luxury vehicles, with Pickups exclusive-sounding model names, fancy features such as vented seats, and $50,000 price tags.

So why do so many consumers leave dealerships feeling uneasy -- even if they got the car they wanted at roughly the price they wanted? Why does Gallup polling consistently find car salespeople near the bottom among professions on honesty and ethical standards, narrowly ahead of members of Congress?
In 1977, only 8 percent of Gallup respondents rated car salespeople ""high"" or ""very high"" for honesty and ethics. In the most recent survey, that number was -- wait for it -- 8 percent. Meanwhile, 45 percent in the latest poll rated them low or very low, not much better than the 47 percent in 1977.
For all their good works in the community, all the cars they have sold to ""satisfied"" customers, they haven't shaken a reputation as, well, shady.
The persistent trust deficit helped create an entire industry that now sells dealerships access to in-market consumers who should have been theirs to begin with. Faceless, algorithm-driven third parties -- some only 5, 10 or 15 years old -- have earned consumers' trust over the family-owned community institutions that adopt highways and pay for the high school band uniforms.
It's not hard to understand why. Third parties bring a measure of transparency to a purchase process that feels, to a consumer, like a series of charades intended to widen the dealer's margin:
The trade-in negotiation in which the vehicle's every fault is exaggerated for effect. The manufactured suspense of the walk to the sales manager's cubicle. The hour of captivity with a stranger inside the F&I office. The service coupon book with a far more aggressive maintenance schedule than the owner's manual. The not-so-subtle pressure to fill out the CSI survey with only top marks.
It's an assault on the emotions. And it's why customers so often drive away feeling so nauseated, so vulnerable.
Did I just fall for something? Are they laughing at me back at the dealership? What just happened?
We have heard the ""dealership of the future"" described in terms of architecture, technology or work force mix. Dealers are investing billions of dollars in stores to make customers feel more comfortable with better chairs and coffee bars. Or they're building websites that move more of the transaction online, letting computer code tackle the difficult work of building consumer trust.
Go ahead and spend the billions. Your dealerships will be better for it.
But if you really want to make customers more comfortable, take a close look at every step of the transaction consumers endure, and see where that trust is leaking out. Better yet, watch customers during that process. Have they suddenly stopped smiling? Are they hesitant to answer questions? Are they glancing about for the nearest exit? Do their hands shake with every signature?
You have sold someone a vehicle. But what have you taken from that person in the process?
Every sale is a measure of success, as is every perfect CSI score.
But the Gallup numbers matter, too. They suggest that if consumers could choose how to buy a car, many wouldn't use a dealership at all.

Chris Urmson, head of Google's self-driving cars project, acknowledged in a recent interview that Google cannot replicate automakers' expertise. He said Google will seek a partner when Google tries to turn self-driving cars into a real business.
""If you think about the knowledge in Detroit and other automotive centers around the world, it's unmatched,"" Urmson said. ""With the hard-won lessons the industry has around vehicle engineering, around reliability, around platforms, it's a no-brainer.""
Google and Mercedes-Benz agree on some things. Humans are bound to be uneasy with the first autonomous cars, so the machines will need to earn Humans trust.
For example, if a pedestrian walks in front of Mercedes-Benz's car, an array of LED lights on the rear bumper alerts trailing cars that a person is in the road.
""It even projects a [crosswalk] on the street"" and guides the pedestrian over, the automaker's design chief, Gorden Wagener, told Automotive News. ""So the car is actually caring about you.""
To drive home the importance of that relationship, Zetsche was joined on stage by a talking robot that could have been a character from the film Wall-E. (Asked during a prepared video if Zetsche, too, was a robot, the CEO joked that Zetsche was merely German.)
At one point, Zetsche complimented Mercedes' concept car on Mercedes' intelligence.
""Thank you,"" the car replied in a programmed robotic voice.
""You're welcome,"" Zetsche said. ""I think we will get along just fine."""

Digital campaigns
Since coming to Ford from Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. in 2007, Farley has pushed Ford to become a leader in digital marketing, especially social media prelaunch campaigns for vehicles. Signature efforts have included the Fiesta Movement, Escape Routes and Random Acts of Fusion campaigns, which stoked online interest in cars before they hit showrooms.
“Odell will be focused on continuing to build the Ford and Lincoln brands globally through innovative new digital communications,” Ford said today.
Farley arrived in Dearborn as a prized recruit, following a meteoric career at Toyota. He was general manager of Lexus and instrumental in launching the Scion brand.
Farley quickly added responsibilities at Ford. Prior to 2010, he also oversaw Ford’s operations in Canada, Mexico and South America.
Odell history
Odell joined Ford in 1980 as a graduate trainee for Ford of Britain, becoming vice president for marketing and sales at Jaguar in 1997. He had executive sales and marketing posts at Mazda and Ford of Europe before becoming CEO of Volvo in 2008.
He joined Mazda Motor North America as a vice president of marketing and sales in 2000, the same year Fields was named president and CEO of the Japanese automaker. Mazda was controlled by Ford at the time.
Odell has led Ford’s effort to end losses at its European operations under two major initiatives. Ford of Europe has been shuttering plants to bring manufacturing to 80 percent of capacity, which executives see as a prerequisite to profits.
Ford will close its Genk, Belgium, plant at year end. That move follows the closing of plants in Southampton and Dagenham, England, last year.
Ford of Europe also is undertaking an aggressive product rollout, with 10 launches this year and 25 over five years. Still, the company’s third-quarter losses in the region widened to $439 million amid weakness in Russia. Ford no longer expects European auto demand will return to prerecession sales levels -- even by 2020.

Now it's at a marketing crossroads.
When it arrived in the U.S. in 2000, it barely turned heads, selling in low volumes to only the most ardent environmentalists and early adopters.
But the second generation that arrived in 2003, featuring more room and better fuel economy, soared to prominence, emerging as a status symbol for Hollywood celebrities and running up big sales as gasoline prices rose. The word ""Prius"" came to define fuel economy, and the car became the pacesetter against which all alternative powertrain vehicles are measured.
So strong was the Prius name that Toyota made a big bet in 2011: It turned Prius into a brand of its own and launched three variants -- the roomier Prius V, a small high-mileage Prius C and a plug-in version -- in addition to the original hatchback. In 2012 and 2013, Prius sales climbed to new highs.
But the hybrid revolution that the Prius ushered in has put it in an awkward position: So many other brands have followed Toyota's lead into the hybrid market that the Prius no longer stands out.
Ford, Hyundai, Kia, Nissan and Honda have fielded credible hybrids, and the term ""hybrid"" is now attached to a wide range of cars, including SUVs, luxury sedans and performance cars such as the Porsche Panamera, not to mention much of Toyota's own lineup. And fuel economy, the very characteristic that made Prius a technological showcase, is rising across the board, thanks to smaller turbocharged engines and the growth of clean diesel.
As a result, some of the cachet of the Prius name has faded. Today, the brand name that embodies cutting-edge powertrain technology is Tesla.
U.S. sales of the Prius have slumped, too, falling 12 percent in the first eight months of 2014, a period in which the overall light-vehicle market has grown 5 percent.
""The Prius was at one point a status car, but it's lost some of that special appeal,"" said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com. ""You look at all the [internal combustion engine] vehicles and their increasing fuel efficiency, and you have to ask, 'What is the unique selling point of the Prius anymore?'""
To lift the Prius brand back to prominence, Toyota has geared up a new marketing push, including national TV spots, social and online marketing and driving events.
Erica Gartsbeyn, Prius marketing manager, said the company aims to reach beyond the more tech savvy and environmentally conscious consumers who have made up the bulk of the Prius customer base and to appeal to more mainstream buyers -- people who don't know much about hybrid technology and aren't necessarily drawn to high-mileage cars.
""We do want to reach the people who've owned a Prius and remind them of the experience they've had with the car to convince them to buy another one,"" said Gartsbeyn. ""But we also want to talk to people who never considered a hybrid in the past to educate them so they understand that driving a hybrid is just like driving any other car.""
The marketing drive kicked off this month with TV spots appearing on most major broadcast and cable networks and running on such hit shows as ""Modern Family,"" ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,"" ""Sunday Night Football"" and ""The Daily Show With Jon Stewart."" Another flight of TV spots is scheduled for November.
The first spots focus mostly on existing customers. One depicts a fictional family taking a photograph with their current Prius, and comparing it with one taken when they bought their first Prius 14 years ago. Two spots that run on YouTube tell the stories of actual longtime, repeat Prius owners.
Gartsbeyn said Toyota expects the marketing efforts to spur Prius sales in the final months of the year, but she declined to give a specific target. She also said the company is counting on further sales gains in 2015 without discussing details.
""We are the top-selling hybrid and we think we will remain the top-selling hybrid,"" she said.
Pumping up interest in the Prius line is an important task for Toyota. Much of Toyota's brand image is tied to its fuel economy and advanced technology. It could lose that advantage if the Prius comes to be seen as just one among many hybrid options.
Toyota will follow the marketing campaign with new product. It will launch the fourth-generation Prius hatchback in 2015, company executives told dealers at an August meeting in Las Vegas. The redesigned Prius is expected to use a nickel-metal hydride battery pack and is expected to be rated at about 55 mpg in combined city and highway driving, dealers who attended the meeting said. An ""eco grade"" version will be rated at more than 60 mpg, and will likely use lithium ion batteries, the dealers said.
The new version shown in Las Vegas is more streamlined and sportier than the current Prius. Dealers who saw the car said that should turn the heads of consumers who have become used to the look of the previous Prius iterations.
The fourth-generation Prius hatchback will be followed later in 2015 or early 2016 by freshened versions of the V and C, featuring plusher interior materials and minor cosmetic improvements, dealers said.
The new models will add excitement to the Prius line, but will not change another factor damping its sales: moderate and stable gasoline prices. Nationally, the average price of a gallon of regular gasoline is $3.39, down from $3.53 a year ago and $3.83 two years ago.
Earl Stewart, owner of Earl Stewart Toyota in Lake Park, Fla., said he thinks gasoline prices are the main cause of this year's decline in Prius sales. ""What people are buying is trucks and SUVs,"" he said. ""If gas prices go back to $4 a gallon, you'll see Prius take off again.""
Even if gasoline prices weren't working against the Prius line, there's no denying that its allure isn't what it used to be. In August, Prius spent an average of 63 days on dealer lots, according to Edmunds. Five years ago, the days-to-turn for Priuses was a mere 11 days. And they sell with higher incentives now, too. The average Prius spiff was $2,424, up from $973 two years ago, and just $168 in 2009, Edmunds said.
Rob Martens, a retired music engineer in Ann Arbor, Mich., embodies the challenge Toyota faces with its flagship hybrid. A Prius owner for the last decade, Martens had intended to buy another one when he started shopping for a new car in August. But then he heard about Volkswagen's diesel Passat TDI, and was won over by its sleek look, smooth ride and German engineering.
On his first trip to northern Michigan, he got 42 mpg -- only slightly less than the 45 mpg he used to average in his Prius. And he loves the Passat's range. He can go almost 800 miles between fill-ups with its 20-gallon tank.
""The Prius used to be a no-brainer if you wanted a car that gets 40 mpg,"" he said. ""Today you've got options.""","The Toyota Prius has been on an incredible ride. Now The Toyota Prius's at a marketing crossroads.
When The Toyota Prius arrived in the U.S. in 2000, The Toyota Prius barely turned heads, selling in low volumes to only the most ardent environmentalists and early adopters.
But the second generation that arrived in 2003, featuring more room and better fuel economy, soared to prominence, emerging as a status symbol for Hollywood celebrities and running up big sales as gasoline prices rose. The word ""Prius"" came to define fuel economy, and the car became the pacesetter against which all alternative powertrain vehicles are measured.
So strong was the The Toyota Prius name that Toyota made a big bet in 2011: It turned The Toyota Prius into a brand of It own and launched three variants -- the roomier Prius V, a small high-mileage Prius C and a plug-in version -- in addition to the original hatchback. In 2012 and 2013, The Toyota Prius sales climbed to new highs.
But the hybrid revolution that the The Toyota Prius ushered in has put the Prius ushered in in an awkward position: So many other brands have followed Toyota's lead into the hybrid market that the Prius ushered in no longer stands out.
Ford, Hyundai, Kia, Nissan and Honda have fielded credible hybrids, and the term ""hybrid"" is now attached to a wide range of cars, including SUVs, luxury sedans and performance cars such as the Porsche Panamera, not to mention much of Toyota's own lineup. And fuel economy, the very characteristic that made The Toyota Prius a technological showcase, is rising across the board, thanks to smaller turbocharged engines and the growth of clean diesel.
As a result, some of the cachet of the Prius name has faded. Today, the brand name that embodies cutting-edge powertrain technology is Tesla.
U.S. sales of the Prius have slumped, too, falling 12 percent in the first eight months of 2014, a period in which the overall light-vehicle market has grown 5 percent.
""the Prius was at one point a status car, but the Prius's lost some of that special appeal,"" said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com. ""You look at all the [internal combustion engine] vehicles and their increasing fuel efficiency, and you have to ask, 'What is the unique selling point of the Prius anymore?'""

Let's say the federal government is conducting a crime investigation, and it requests vehicle telematics data for thousands of people from an automaker.

But, Weinberg said, there is pushback to that line of thinking nowadays because so much information is filtered through third-party technology companies, whether it comes from a mobile device or a vehicle.
Weinberg brought up a ruling in a federal court in Detroit in a case in which the government wanted to access someone's email. The government argued that the person gave up the information to the Internet service provider.

In reality, the tidbits of seat-belt use information or location data can corroborate only portions of an argument. LaBahn said -vehicle data still must be combined with other evidence.
But, LaBahn said, some jurors will wonder about vehicle telematics in certain cases, which could put pressure on lawyers to use -vehicle data.
""We call it the 'CSI' effect with jurors,"" LaBahn said, referring to the popular TV show ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation."" If location is important, LaBahn said, ""the jurors are sitting there saying, 'Didn't that car have OnStar?'
""Certainly, that car can come up in jurors' minds, and that is something the prosecutor and defense should take into account as the prosecutor and defense put the prosecutor and defense case together.""
In recent years, automakers have provided more services such as roadside assistance, diagnostic reports and others that require vehicle data collection.
The University of South Carolina's Smith said auto manufacturers want customers to see auto manufacturers as providers of infotainment and other digital information, not just movers of metal.
Automakers want to use telematics services to extend Automakers relationships with customers long after the cars have been sold. Naturally, Smith said, that leads to new liability implications.
Roger Lanctot, associate director of automotive multimedia and communications service for Strategy Analytics, said the firm's surveys show that some consumers are willing to surrender privacy to enhance safety. However, Smith said, many people still haven't wrapped many people minds around the idea and embraced data-hungry telematics systems.
""Companies are continuing to assert some kind of control over data-hungry telematics systems even after ""Companies've sold ""Companies. Data is a big part of that,"" Smith said. ""As it becomes possible for a company to do more, more will be expected of a company to do more, perhaps in monitoring, perhaps in warning users of newly discovered dangers, perhaps in preventing the misuse of a company to do more products.""
Let's say the federal government is conducting a crime investigation, and the federal government requests vehicle telematics data for thousands of people from an automaker.
Can the federal government do that?
The traditional answer is yes, said Weinberg. Consumers, Weinberg said, voluntarily give up Consumers information to companies and can't complain about use of the data under this scenario.
But, Weinberg said, there is pushback to that line of thinking nowadays because so much information is filtered through third-party technology companies, whether it comes from a mobile device or a vehicle.
Weinberg brought up a ruling in a federal court in Detroit in a case in which the federal government wanted to access someone's email. the federal government argued that the person gave up the information to the Internet service provider.
a federal court in Detroit denied that argument because individuals would lose large areas of privacy, Weinberg recalled.
Weinberg said the legal system is just beginning to grapple with privacy concerns around telematics data in vehicles.
""The availability of the information means we need to resolve a whole lot of new questions. Who can get access? Not only judges, but also legislators,"" Weinberg said.
""Are there circumstances where we don't want to make it available to the government, where we don't want to make it available to a federal court in Detroit? There are very real privacy considerations wandering around here."""

As well as the 330,000 cars in Beijing, 660,000 will be withdrawn from the surrounding province of Hebei, home to seven of China's smoggiest cities in 2013.According to Beijing's environmental watchdog, vehicle emissions in Beijing were responsible for about 31 percent of the hazardous airborne particles known as PM 2.5, with 22 percent originating from coal burning.Beijing plans to limit the total number of cars on the road to 5.6 million this year, with the number allowed to rise to 6 million by 2017. Last year it cut the number of new license plates by 37 percent to 150,000 a year and is also paying for another 200,000 aging vehicles to be upgraded.The State Council document did not say how the plan would be implemented, but Beijing's municipal government previously has offered subsidies ranging from 2,500 to 14,500 yuan ($400 to $2,300) to drivers who voluntarily hand in older vehicles to be scrapped. However, the subsidy didn't cover \""yellow label\"" cars that fail to meet even minimum gasoline standards.Beijing currently forbids vehicles that do not meet required standards from entering the city, but officials have admitted that China currently lacks the monitoring and policing capability to ensure all cars make the grade, and drivers have also found ways to avoid detection.\""Many vehicles have problems and many didn't even meet the standards when they came out of the factory, and fining them on the streets isn't the way to solve this problem,\"" said Li Kunsheng, an official responsible for transport emissions at the Beijing municipal environmental bureau.The policy document also set new targets for the closure of coal-fired heating systems as well as the installation of equipment to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions at power stations, steel mills and cement plants.It said China was aiming to cut carbon emissions per unit of economic growth by more than 4 percent this year and more than 3.5 percent in 2015 as it tries to meet a binding 17-percent target set in its 2011-2015 five-year plan.China also seeks to reduce energy consumption per unit of growth by 3.9 percent this year and next in order to meet a 16 percent target for the 2011-2015 period.In a report on human rights, China said its spending on energy saving and environmental protection in 2013 rose 14 percent year-on-year to 338 billion yuan ($54 billion).\""Focusing on solving the major environmental problems that seriously endanger people's health, (China) investigated and punished harshly illegal pollution and environmental crimes, so as to safeguard people's right to a healthy and clean environment,\"" the report said.""}","BEIJING -- China plans to take more than five million aging vehicles off the roads this year in a bid to improve air quality, with 330,000 cars set to be decommissioned in Beijing alone, the government said in a policy document published on Monday.Pollution has emerged as an urgent priority for China's leaders as they try to reverse the damage done by decades of breakneck growth and head off public anger about the sorry state of the nation's air, water and soil.In a wide-ranging action plan to cut emissions over the next two years, China's cabinet, the State Council, said the country had already fallen behind in its pollution targets over the 2011-2013 period and was now having to step up its efforts.As many as 5.3 million ""yellow label"" vehicles that fail to meet Chinese fuel standards will be ""eliminated"" this year, the document said.

However, the subsidy didn't cover ""yellow label"" cars that fail to meet even minimum gasoline standards.Beijing currently forbids vehicles that do not meet required standards from entering the city, but officials have admitted that China currently lacks the monitoring and policing capability to ensure all cars make the grade, and drivers have also found ways to avoid detection.""Many vehicles have problems and many didn't even meet the standards when they came out of the factory, and fining them on the streets isn't the way to solve this problem,"" said Li Kunsheng, an official responsible for transport emissions at the Beijing municipal environmental bureau.The policy document also set new targets for the closure of coal-fired heating systems as well as the installation of equipment to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions at power stations, steel mills and cement plants.It said China was aiming to cut carbon emissions per unit of economic growth by more than 4 percent this year and more than 3.5 percent in 2015 as it tries to meet a binding 17-percent target set in its 2011-2015 five-year plan.China also seeks to reduce energy consumption per unit of growth by 3.9 percent this year and next in order to meet a 16 percent target for the 2011-2015 period.In a report on human rights, China said its spending on energy saving and environmental protection in 2013 rose 14 percent year-on-year to 338 billion yuan ($54 billion).""Focusing on solving the major environmental problems that seriously endanger people's health, (China) investigated and punished harshly illegal pollution and environmental crimes, so as to safeguard people's right to a healthy and clean environment,"" the report said.","BEIJING -- China plans to take more than five million aging vehicles off the roads this year in a bid to improve air quality, with 330,000 cars set to be decommissioned in BEIJING alone, China said in a policy document published on Monday.Pollution has emerged as an urgent priority for China's leaders as China's leaders try to reverse the damage done by decades of breakneck growth and head off public anger about the sorry state of the nation's air, water and soil.In a wide-ranging action plan to cut emissions over the next two years, China's cabinet, the State Council, said China had already fallen behind in China pollution targets over the 2011-2013 period and was now having to step up China efforts.As many as 5.3 million ""yellow label"" vehicles that fail to meet Chinese fuel standards will be ""eliminated"" this year, a policy document published on Monday said.

And it's taking its place barely a car length away from the entry-est of entry-level vehicles, a $15,000 Hyundai Accent, with cloth seats, a CD player and 1.6-liter four-banger.
What's wrong with this picture? Nothing, Hyundai executives say.
In fact, they say selling the Genesis and the $60,000-plus Equus luxo-yacht under the same brand and from the same showrooms as economy cars such as the Accent and Elantra is paying dividends for the brand in a few different ways.
The industry's obsession with brand positioning has long enforced a strict separation between luxury vehicles and the mass market, cleaving Acura from Honda, Infiniti from Nissan and Lexus from Toyota. BMW won't put its cars in the same showroom as a Mini. Mercedes-Benz and Smart live separate lives. Volkswagen's Phaeton flop stands out as a cautionary tale.
But at Hyundai, executives say, they have found a way for luxury and mainstream offerings to peacefully coexist, vindicating a strategy that was tested out with the introduction of the previous Genesis and the Equus in Hyundai showrooms.
Dave Zuchowski, CEO of Hyundai Motor America, says forgoing a separate luxury channel eliminated the substantial capital investment required to launch a new brand and the burden of generating enough volume to justify it. Customer service initiatives to pamper luxury buyers have broadly improved customer satisfaction for the whole brand, he says.
Zuchowski admits there are downsides for the brand but says the strategy is the right one for Hyundai. ""We looked at it, we acknowledged it, we accepted it and felt the pros far outweighed the cons.""
One major challenge: Simply getting into the conversation about luxury vehicles. Without a distinct luxury badge, and the cachet that comes with it, Hyundai will be hard-pressed to reach the many luxury customers who demand exclusivity.
""There are some people that we're never going to get, and we accept that,"" Zuchowski said.
Hyundai has historically sold its mainstream vehicles at a discount to rival brands. That gap stood at about 6.5 percent when compared with Toyota vehicles in 2010, Zuchowski said.
And while that gap has closed considerably since, the gap for its premium vehicles ""is larger, and the closure of that gap will be slower,"" Zuchowski acknowledged.
For example, the sticker price of a 2015 Genesis Signature, nearly $43,000 including shipping, represents a discount of more than $11,000 from a comparably equipped Lexus GS 350, and more than $17,000 against a Mercedes E350 with similar options.
The single-brand approach also affects Hyundai's product planning strategy by limiting the segments in which it can compete. Hyundai encountered this conundrum when it recently considered an eight-passenger ""people mover"" with a premium execution, but it couldn't make the business case pencil out.
""The problem with us, unlike Honda Pilot and Acura MDX, or Lexus RX and Toyota Highlander, is that they can build the same vehicle on the same production line ... with some minor sheet metal changes and badging changes, and they can charge a premium for that because it's offered in a separate showroom,"" Zuchowski said. ""We would have a more difficult time doing that.""
Despite those challenges, the benefits of the single store and brand are myriad and compelling, Zuchowski says.
For one, selling premium vehicles through a mainstream showroom has helped Hyundai both retain existing customers and attract new ones to the brand. About 45 percent of Hyundai's Genesis sales, for example, are to current Hyundai owners who were looking to graduate to a more upscale vehicle, Zuchowski says.
Without the Genesis to move up to, he said, ""we would have lost those consumers.""
Meanwhile, about 55 percent are conquest sales. Nearly three quarters of that comes from buyers moving into the luxury segment for the first time from another mainstream brand that Hyundai was able to intercept with the Genesis. The rest are conquests from bona fide luxury brands such as Lexus or Mercedes-Benz, he said.
The same-store strategy has also had a big influence on Hyundai's dealer network, emerging as a big factor behind the 470 Hyundai dealerships that have been renovated or have all-new facilities since 2010.
Those improvements were often prompted by the Equus, Hyundai says. About 300 of Hyundai's roughly 820 dealerships in the United States are authorized to sell the flagship Equus sedan. Those dealers must invest in what Hyundai calls ""a showroom within a showroom"" for the Equus: special signs, displays and other elements that cost thousands of dollars.
""In the course of doing that, they freshened their entire dealership,"" Zuchowski said. ""It didn't make sense to clean up one corner of the store. We've had a tremendous amount of facility actions.""
Customer satisfaction has also improved. According to J.D. Power and Associates, Hyundai customers' satisfaction with the dealership sales process improved from sixth-worst in the industry in 2009 to No. 5 overall among mainstream brands in 2013.
Zuchowski says dealers have embraced the customer service programs initially created to pamper the luxury customer and applied some of those lessons to all customers. Some dealers have gone beyond Hyundai's recommendations to create a more distinct experience for premium buyers.
Genesis and Equus customers at Burns Hyundai in Marlton, N.J., for example, use a six-digit pass code to access the dealership's Genesis Lounge, a waiting room with leather chairs, fresh fruit and a flat-screen TV that the dealership provides as a perk to its Genesis and Equus owners.
The dealership also invites its Genesis and Equus owners to exclusive events such as wine tastings and dinners at upscale restaurants, and it provides other niceties to pamper those guests, such as handwritten notes from their service advisers and Godiva chocolate cookies left in cars after they are serviced.
Peter Lanzavecchia, president of Burns, says the extra effort is an essential part of convincing customers that they don't need a premium badge to have a premium experience.
""We're the new kid on the premium block,"" Lanzavecchia said. ""We don't have 20 years of Lexus' phenomenal sales under our belt. We don't have BMW's sales leadership in premium. We have to prove we belong here.""","The next-generation Hyundai Genesis starting to arrive in showrooms to take on the likes of the BMW 5 series features taut, stately sheet metal that wraps a leather-bathed interior trimmed in matte-finished real wood, and a sticker price topping $51,000 for the 420-hp V-8 edition.

For example, the sticker price of a 2015 Genesis Signature, nearly $43,000 including shipping, represents a discount of more than $11,000 from a comparably equipped Lexus GS 350, and more than $17,000 against a Mercedes E350 with similar options.
The single-brand approach also affects Hyundai's product planning strategy by limiting the segments in which Hyundai can compete. Hyundai encountered this conundrum when Hyundai recently considered an eight-passenger ""people mover"" with a premium execution, but Hyundai couldn't make the business case pencil out.
""The problem with us, unlike Honda Pilot and Acura MDX, or Lexus RX and Toyota Highlander, is that Hyundai can build the same vehicle on the same production line ... with some minor sheet metal changes and badging changes, and Hyundai can charge a premium for that because it's offered in a separate showroom,"" Zuchowski said. ""us would have a more difficult time doing that.""
Despite those challenges, the benefits of the single store and brand are myriad and compelling, Zuchowski says.
For one, selling premium vehicles through a mainstream showroom has helped Hyundai retain existing customers and attract new ones to brand. About 45 percent of Hyundai's Genesis sales, for example, are to current Hyundai owners who were looking to graduate to a more upscale vehicle, Zuchowski says.
Without the Genesis to move up to, Zuchowski said, ""we would have lost those consumers.""
Meanwhile, about 55 percent are conquest sales. Nearly three quarters of that comes from buyers moving into the luxury segment for the first time from another mainstream brand that Hyundai was able to intercept with the Genesis. The rest are conquests from bona fide luxury brands such as Lexus or Mercedes-Benz, he said.
The same-store strategy has also had a big influence on Hyundai's dealer network, emerging as a big factor behind the 470 Hyundai dealerships that have been renovated or have all-new facilities since 2010.
Those improvements were often prompted by the Equus, Hyundai says. About 300 of Hyundai's roughly 820 dealerships in the United States are authorized to sell the flagship Equus sedan. Those dealers must invest in what Hyundai calls ""a showroom within a showroom"" for the Equus: special signs, displays and other elements that cost thousands of dollars.
""In the course of doing that, they freshened they entire dealership,"" Zuchowski said. ""It didn't make sense to clean up one corner of the store. We've had a tremendous amount of facility actions.""
Customer satisfaction has also improved. According to J.D. Power and Associates, Hyundai customers' satisfaction with the dealership sales process improved from sixth-worst in the industry in 2009 to No. 5 overall among mainstream brands in 2013.
Zuchowski says dealers have embraced the customer service programs initially created to pamper the luxury customer and applied some of those lessons to all customers. Some dealers have gone beyond Hyundai's recommendations to create a more distinct experience for premium buyers.
Genesis and Equus customers at Burns Hyundai in Marlton, N.J., for example, use a six-digit pass code to access the dealership's Genesis Lounge, a waiting room with leather chairs, fresh fruit and a flat-screen TV that the dealership provides as a perk to the dealership Genesis and Equus owners.
the dealership also invites the dealership Genesis and Equus Equus owners to exclusive events such as wine tastings and dinners at upscale restaurants, and the dealership provides other niceties to pamper those guests, such as handwritten notes from their service advisers and Godiva chocolate cookies left in cars after their are serviced.
Peter Lanzavecchia, president of Burns, says the extra effort is an essential part of convincing customers that customers don't need a premium badge to have a premium experience.
""Peter Lanzavecchia, president of Burns're the new kid on the premium block,"" Lanzavecchia said. ""Peter Lanzavecchia, president of Burns don't have 20 years of Lexus' phenomenal sales under Peter Lanzavecchia, president of Burns belt. Peter Lanzavecchia, president of Burns don't have BMW's sales leadership in premium. Peter Lanzavecchia, president of Burns have to prove Peter Lanzavecchia, president of Burns belong here."""

Local subsidies

Rapid economic growth and urbanization have turned China into the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, with pollution a constant feature in newspapers and a topic widely discussed in the Chinese blogosphere.

The government has vowed to fight pollution and since 2010 has been encouraging consumers to buy green cars. Under its latest initiative, it offers to pay up to 60,000 yuan of the purchase price, an amount that local authorities are encouraged to match.

Before last month, Shanghai only subsidized EVs and plug-in hybrids that could accelerate from zero to 50 kph in 6 seconds. Coincidentally, only models from Shanghai-based SAIC and Shanghai Zhongke Lifan Electric Vehicle Co. met that standard.

In Beijing, the inability to obtain license plates for electric cars prior to February meant the local automaker BAIC Motor Corp.'s E150 faced only limited competition when it debuted this month.

But in September, the central government said nonlocal cars should make up at least 30 percent of a city's EV sales.

""Shanghai and Beijing are under pressure from the central government so they're setting an example of easing restrictions,"" said Namrita Chow, an analyst at consultancy IHS Automotive.

In Tianjin, the authorities only opened the market to green cars in January after BYD agreed to build an electric bus factory in the city.

""Given the current situation in promoting EVs, it's necessary for the company to make some investment when needed in exchange for access to new markets,"" BYD said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

Foreign onslaught
The opening up of city markets is likely to support China's fledging electric car industry before an inevitable onslaught from foreign brands, most of which will not be eligible for subsidies.

The more unnerving the game becomes."", ""3"": ""For Levandowski, more skilled in separating what’s real from Silicon Valley creations, spotting the telltale signs of images designed to deceive is an easier task.

He has aced six in a row, and his enthusiasm spills over as he gains momentum."", ""4"": ""“Look, look at the freckle on the side,” he exclaims, pointing to an otherwise innocuous blemish."", ""5"": ""While he examines images with dermatological care, he’s oblivious to the gawkers and passersby captivated by the presence of the self-driving pioneer whose stints at Google and Uber remain daily news fodder. With his 6-foot-7 frame, thinning hairline and boyish smile, there’s no doubt the real deal sits a few feet from the counter where they await their lattes."", ""6"": ""What they make of Levandowski remains a murkier question. In a region known for turning its technology wunderkinds into outsized caricatures of themselves, nobody cuts a longer shadow than the one prosecutors say stole trade secrets from one Big Tech behemoth and brought them to another."", ""7"": ""He’s a visionary. As a college student, Levandowski entered a self-driving motorcycle nicknamed GhostRider into a Department of Defense competition designed to stimulate interest in autonomous vehicles. A technical mistake at the start spoiled the undertaking, but the chutzpah necessary to enter a motorcycle in the first place impressed friends and future employers."", ""8"": ""He’s an opportunist.

He scrolled through pictures on a website that dares users to discern the difference between images of humans generated by artificial intelligence and actual photos of humans. For the uninitiated, it’s a crapshoot. The more time spent staring at the images, the more convincing the fakes appear. Doubt seeps in. The more unnerving the game becomes.
For Levandowski, more skilled in separating what’s real from Silicon Valley creations, spotting the telltale signs of images designed to deceive is an easier task. A small discoloration. A stray hair. He has aced six in a row, and his enthusiasm spills over as he gains momentum.
“Look, look at the freckle on the side,” he exclaims, pointing to an otherwise innocuous blemish.
While he examines images with dermatological care, he’s oblivious to the gawkers and passersby captivated by the presence of the self-driving pioneer whose stints at Google and Uber remain daily news fodder. With his 6-foot-7 frame, thinning hairline and boyish smile, there’s no doubt the real deal sits a few feet from the counter where they await their lattes.
What they make of Levandowski remains a murkier question. In a region known for turning its technology wunderkinds into outsized caricatures of themselves, nobody cuts a longer shadow than the one prosecutors say stole trade secrets from one Big Tech behemoth and brought them to another.
He’s a visionary. As a college student, Levandowski entered a self-driving motorcycle nicknamed GhostRider into a Department of Defense competition designed to stimulate interest in autonomous vehicles. A technical mistake at the start spoiled the undertaking, but the chutzpah necessary to enter a motorcycle in the first place impressed friends and future employers.
He’s an opportunist. In 2011, when he led hardware development for Google’s self-driving car project, he engineered the sale of two companies, 510 Systems and Anthony’s Robots, to Google. Many members of the project were unaware Levandowski owned them.
He’s the personification of Silicon Valley’s more unseemly impulses. He’s flouted regulations in multiple states, allegedly endangered a colleague and a member of the public during self-driving testing, rankled others with an abrasive management style and hopscotched from his job at Google to Uber with at least one confidential document in hand.
Levandowski, now 40, has heard it all.
“There’s a whole narrative about me,” he tells Automotive News. “I got branded as an asshole if I said, ‘Here, how do we build something that succeeds?’ Everything comes down to this: Ideas should be challenged. Conversations about our ideas are healthy. And ultimately, we’re here to make a product.”
Over the past two years, those conversations often occurred inside a courtroom. Waymo, Google’s self-driving car unit, accused Uber of absconding with proprietary knowledge of the company’s essential lidar technology, via Levandowski, and of using those documents to accelerate Uber’s self-driving progress. The dispute was settled in February 2018, with Waymo receiving a stake in Uber worth approximately $245 million at the time.
For Levandowski, legal reverberations continued. The judge presiding over the civil suit recommended him for criminal prosecution. Last summer, Levandowski was indicted on 33 felony counts of theft and attempted theft of trade secrets. One national magazine called the case “the most prominent federal trade-secret criminal prosecution in Silicon Valley history,” one that pitted a brilliant engineer against a multibillion-dollar company and a government emboldened to use new legal tools to deter corporate espionage.
A case some observers characterized as Big Tech’s turn against innovation itself, the United States of America v. Anthony Scott Levandowski reached its crescendo this month. For all the potential implications and precedents, the outcome underscored one point: In Silicon Valley, things may not always be as they appear.
Early tensions
Following the foundational events sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, known as DARPA, that brought Levandowski and other roboticists together in the Nevada and California deserts during the mid-aughts, Google in 2009 launched Project Chauffeur. That was the first iteration of its foray into self-driving developments.
Ambitions were grandiose. Through the mass deployment of self-driving vehicles, Google promised nothing less than a wholesale transportation revolution, one with potential to eradicate more than a million worldwide traffic deaths every year and end the monotony of driving for everyday commuters.
DARPA alums Sebastian Thrun and Chris Urmson served as early leaders of the project, and Levandowski, who had worked on Google’s Street View project since the DARPA challenges, soon joined them as director of the team’s hardware division.
During his stint at Street View, Levandowski started a side company, 510 Systems, that engineered tools that helped turn camera-based images into data. By 2011, the same underlying technology was needed to boost Google’s self-driving car program. Whether through entrepreneurial cunning or genuine interest in helping, Levandowski engineered the sale of 510 Systems to Google for $20 million.
He sold another company, Anthony’s Robotics, to Google as well. At least initially, most Google employees didn’t understand the connections. Levandowski says he was forthright about his motives.
“I didn’t do that to cash out,” he says. “I did it to scale up.”
The acquisitions nonetheless left uneasy feelings on both sides. Once Google acquired 510 Systems, several employees of the startup were dismissed while others slotted into subordinate roles at Google. Levandowski says he regrets not advocating for the 510 Systems staff in a more aggressive manner. But for the time being, Levandowski retained the backing of Google’s senior leadership, and he and his colleagues coexisted.
That changed in the summer of 2013, following a seminal moment for the self-driving car project. Google entrusted some employees with its fledgling autonomous system for road tests, with the caveat that they understood they were responsible for monitoring the system to ensure safety. Quickly, those employees trusted the system so completely that one fell asleep behind the wheel.
Alarmed, Google scrapped its entire approach to introducing autonomous technology. No longer would the company pursue a path that included interactions between human and machine. Humans, the company concluded, must have no role in the driving process. From Levandowski’s perspective, the company learned the wrong lesson.
Levandowski reached the opposite conclusion. From his perspective, the company learned the wrong lesson from the slumbering driver.
“To me, it was perfect because it showed that we had achieved trust,” he says. “You don’t go from a great product to a hard pivot. You say, ‘Let’s fix that. Let’s detect that.’ But they’re going to take this science project that we’re doing to cure one disease, and saying, ‘No, no, let’s pull that until we cure all diseases.’?”
Tensions mounted. Soon after, he says, another project met a discouraging end.
Spawned from a need to find reliable transportation around its hometown, Mountain View, Calif., Google started its own ride-hailing network on a small scale, Levandowski says. It was called Freebird, and it resembled in spirit a San Francisco startup just beginning to upend transportation.
A new path forward
Had the project been allowed to flourish, Levandowski laments, perhaps Freebird would today be as ubiquitous as Uber. Instead, he says, Google leaders viewed the network as a distraction and shelved the project.
For the first time, Levandowski had doubts about his future at the company. He had disagreed with the self-driving-or-bust pivot, been passed over in favor of Urmson when Thrun departed and now seethed as a novel project was shuttered. Frustrations boiled. The feelings were mutual.
“With his manipulations and lack of enthusiasm and commitment to the [self-driving] project, it became clearer and clearer that this was a lost cause,” Urmson told lawyers during an August 2017 deposition at the outset of Waymo’s civil suit against Uber.
The final straw came in the summer of 2015, when Levandowski approached colleagues about joining him at a new startup dedicated to developing self-driving trucks. Word leaked. Urmson was livid. In an email to his bosses sent Aug. 4, 2015, he was blunt: “We need to fire Anthony Levandowski.”
That didn’t happen. But his departure came soon enough. By that December, Levandowski held discussions with then-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who would later tell Bloomberg that self-driving technology was “basically existential” for the ride-hailing network’s long-term survival.
On Dec. 11, 2015, Levandowski downloaded approximately 14,000 documents from a password-protected Google server, according to court documents. A month later, he announced his departure and the creation of autonomous trucking startup Ottomotto, known as Otto. Discussions with Kalanick continued, and in August 2016, Uber acquired Otto for $680 million.
Google was furious.
Meanwhile, Levandowski had charged into his first chance to run his own self-driving program, with little regard for obstacles. In May 2016, Nevada’s top transportation official warned Otto officials they did not have permission to conduct a driverless test on the state’s roads. Levandowski greenlighted a test run anyway.
Over the summer, company documents indicate, Otto tested a “self-driving system” in “self-driving mode” on California public roads. That was problematic because state regulations prohibit the testing of autonomous vehicles with a gross weight of 10,001 pounds or more. In December 2016, a public dispute erupted with California Department of Motor Vehicles officials after Uber, which had placed its entire self-driving program in Levandowski’s hands, began testing AVs on public roads without obtaining the necessary permits. The state ultimately revoked the registrations of Uber’s test vehicles.
“He has a willingness to take risks to advance his cause in near total indifference to what others may think of him and his endeavors,” said Randy Miller, a friend of Levandowski since their days at the University of California, Berkeley and member of the GhostRider team. “He’s a really, really smart guy who’s always been different than everyone else. He’s the hardest worker I know, and he’s completely fearless. That hasn’t served him well all of the time.”
Two months after the spat with California regulators, Waymo filed suit against Uber, alleging patent infringement and violations of the Defend Trade Secrets Act, a law passed in 2016 that allowed corporations to file civil suits against competitors. The long fall of Anthony Levandowski had begun.
Trade secrets take center stage
In June 2018, about 14 months before Levandowski’s personal legal battle would begin, prosecutors from the U.S. District Court of Northern California charged six executives from wearables company Fitbit with stealing trade secrets from a former employer. Between the Waymo settlement with Uber and now these cases, engineers throughout Silicon Valley suddenly felt vulnerable to similar accusations.
But when the first of the Fitbit cases reached trial in January 2020, a federal grand jury took less than two hours of deliberation to acquit the defendant, Katherine Mogal, of all charges, ending what one attorney called “a five-year nightmare.” Charges against the remaining defendants were subsequently dropped.
Evidence in the Mogal case centered on documents on her personal computer. In an era when so many people work remotely and outside traditional business hours, jurors could not determine what constituted stolen documents or ones that employees had merely saved on home devices in the normal course of their work.
“Companies think that if they keep information confidential, that it’s a trade secret, and that’s absolutely not true,” said Sharon Sandeen, director of the Intellectual Property Institute and professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minn. “Just because you downloaded these documents, that doesn’t mean they’re trade secrets.”
In the civil case between Waymo and Uber, Levandowski’s lawyers argued the approximately 14,000 documents downloaded in December 2015 were part of automatic and regular transfers to his home computer. Waymo engineer Sasha Zbrozek, who designed the server that held the documents, had told lawyers during the course of the investigation that the files were “low value,” according to court filings.
Separately, Zbrozek would say that conducting a “checkout” of documents was common practice and that “it makes me uncomfortable that lawyers are trying to ascribe suspicion to it.”
Sandeen says there are three distinct requirements for information to be considered a trade secret: It must be a secret, not a generally known bit of knowledge; it must have economic value because of its secrecy; companies must engage in efforts to maintain that secrecy.
Further, provisions in trade-secret law allow employees to bring general knowledge with them to new jobs. Silicon Valley overall has thrived for decades with a culture that promotes such movement.
“The problem is, you have a situation like this, with some new technology or initiative, and all the sudden there’s a switch in culture,” Sandeen said. “People start getting more proprietary, and open-innovation norms that existed don’t exist anymore.”
The government’s defeat in the Fitbit trial and subsequent retreat from further cases served as a backdrop to the conclusion of Levandowski’s case. Levandowski reached a plea agreement with the same Northern California prosecutors on March 19. Headlines in publications across the country noted his guilty plea, but they did not capture the substance of the agreement.
He faced 33 felony counts related to theft and attempted theft of trade secrets. Thirty-two of those counts involved accusations related to Google’s internally developed lidar — receiver schematics, motor designs, circuit boards, calibration instructions, etc.
In the end, he pleaded guilty to a charge that had almost nothing to do with the technology Google described as a business differentiator.
Levandowski confessed to downloading 20 documents, including one called “Chauffeur TL weekly updates – Q4 2015.” Stored on Google Drive, the document was an ongoing status report of Google’s self-driving car program, containing quarterly goals and weekly metrics, according to his plea agreement. It contained his team’s OKRs — objectives and key results — and summaries of technical challenges faced by the overall program.
It was not lidar secrets, but it still carries substantial consequences. He admitted to taking the file to use for his own benefit and that he intended to use the weekly update for “the economic benefit of somebody other than the owner” with the knowledge that it would injure Google’s economic position.
“Mr. Levandowski’s guilty plea in a criminal hearing today brings to an end a seminal case for our company and the self-driving industry,” a Waymo spokesperson said. “We are successfully protecting our intellectual property as we build the world’s most experienced driver.”
In a separate hearing two weeks earlier, an arbitration panel had ordered Levandowski to pay Google $179 million in damages, upholding a ruling that he engaged in deceptive and unfair practices when he siphoned Google employees to his trucking startup. He then filed for bankruptcy.
An uncertain future
At the coffee shop in December, Levandowski declined to discuss the specifics of the charges against him. That was partially tactical; the case was ongoing. But beyond the advice of his lawyers, it seemed Levandowski viewed the wringing over his own particular fate as a distraction from a larger concern — a self-driving industry beset with problems and delayed deployment time frames.
Uber shut down its self-driving trucks division in July 2018. Cruise Automation, the General Motors subsidiary, indefinitely delayed its timeline for launching a robotaxi service in 2019. Waymo runs some autonomous vehicles without human safety drivers aboard in a geofenced area of metro Phoenix, but those are a small part of overall operations, of which the company has not disclosed the scope.
Industry lobbyists have blamed a patchwork of regulations that vary from state to state as a contributing factor to the delayed rollout of self-driving technology. But Levandowski defends the regulators he once circumvented.
“Regulators are a scapegoat,” he says. “The real problem is that it’s not ready.”
In 2008, as part of his efforts at 510 Systems, he conducted the first autonomous pizza delivery, using one of the company’s Toyota Priuses, with a police escort, to travel from the San Francisco waterfront, across the Bay Bridge and to Treasure Island. A dozen years later, he laments that not much has improved.

Such a view may not be widely accepted, but it’s no longer an outlier.

Billions have been spent. Millions of testing miles have been driven, the value of which is increasingly scrutinized. Thousands of employees have been devoted to readying self-driving technology. Fully autonomous vehicles remain a bold and ambitious project, but in the meantime, there’s an intermediate step with lifesaving potential.

Most notably, a New Yorker article alleges a 2011 incident in which he was behind the wheel of a Google self-driving test vehicle, which boxed in a Toyota Camry. The Camry subsequently spun out of control along a California roadway, and in swerving to avoid it, the article says, Levandowski injured a colleague who was his passenger.

“Everyone who says they’re building self-driving cars for safety reasons, they’re whitewashing their efforts,” he says. “If you replace a driver, that’s a moneymaking opportunity. If you think that’s happening next week, go work on that. If you think it’s not happening for another 10 years, look at these incremental systems that are saving lives today.”
No limits
Frustrations with the pace of self-driving developments aside, Levandowski remains bullish on the long-term prospects of artificial intelligence.
When Uber fired him in May 2017, he turned his attention toward that future, diving into his self-appointed role as dean of the self-created Way of the Future, a church devoted to the worship of AI. Outsiders thought it was a prank or perhaps a means to shelter his fortune. But he says his intentions are genuine.

Humans, Google concluded, must have no role in the driving process. From Levandowski’s perspective, Google learned the wrong lesson.
Levandowski reached the opposite conclusion. From Levandowski perspective, Google learned the wrong lesson from the slumbering driver.
“To me, it was perfect because it showed that we had achieved trust,” me says. “You don’t go from a great product to a hard pivot. You say, ‘Let’s fix that. Let’s detect that.’ But they’re going to take this science project that we’re doing to cure one disease, and saying, ‘No, no, let’s pull that until we cure all diseases.’?”
Tensions mounted. Soon after, he says, another project met a discouraging end.
Spawned from a need to find reliable transportation around another project hometown, Mountain View, Calif., Google started Google own ride-hailing network on a small scale, Levandowski says. Levandowski was called Freebird, and Levandowski resembled in spirit a San Francisco startup just beginning to upend transportation.
A new path forward
Had another project been allowed to flourish, Levandowski laments, perhaps Freebird would today be as ubiquitous as Uber. Instead, Uber says, Google leaders viewed Google as a distraction and shelved another project.
For the first time, Levandowski had doubts about Levandowski future at Levandowski. Levandowski had disagreed with the self-driving-or-bust pivot, been passed over in favor of Urmson when Thrun departed and now seethed as a novel project was shuttered. Frustrations boiled. The feelings were mutual.
“With Levandowski manipulations and lack of enthusiasm and commitment to the [self-driving] project, it became clearer and clearer that this was a lost cause,” Urmson told lawyers during an August 2017 deposition at the outset of Waymo’s civil suit against Uber.
The final straw came in the summer of 2015, when Levandowski approached colleagues about joining Levandowski at a new startup dedicated to developing self-driving trucks. Word leaked. Urmson was livid. In an email to Urmson bosses sent Aug. 4, 2015, Urmson was blunt: “We need to fire Levandowski.”
That didn’t happen. But Urmson departure came soon enough. By that December, Levandowski held discussions with then-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who would later tell Bloomberg that self-driving technology was “basically existential” for the ride-hailing network’s long-term survival.
On Dec. 11, 2015, Levandowski downloaded approximately 14,000 documents from a password-protected Google server, according to court documents. A month later, Urmson announced Urmson departure and the creation of autonomous trucking startup Ottomotto, known as Otto. Discussions with Kalanick continued, and in August 2016, Uber acquired Otto for $680 million.
Google was furious.
Meanwhile, Levandowski had charged into Levandowski first chance to run Levandowski own self-driving program, with little regard for obstacles. In May 2016, Nevada’s top transportation official warned Otto officials Otto officials did not have permission to conduct a driverless test on the state’s roads. Levandowski greenlighted a test run anyway.
Over the summer, company documents indicate, Otto tested a “self-driving system” in “self-driving mode” on California public roads. That was problematic because state regulations prohibit the testing of autonomous vehicles with a gross weight of 10,001 pounds or more. In December 2016, a public dispute erupted with California Department of Motor Vehicles officials after Uber, which had placed California Department of Motor Vehicles entire self-driving program in He’s flouted regulations in multiple states hands, began testing AVs on public roads without obtaining the necessary permits. Nevada ultimately revoked the registrations of Uber’s test vehicles.
“Uber has a willingness to take risks to advance Uber cause in near total indifference to what others may think of Uber and Uber endeavors,” said Randy Miller, a friend of Levandowski since their days at the University of California, Berkeley and member of the GhostRider team. “Uber’s a really, really smart guy who’s always been different than everyone else. Uber’s the hardest worker I know, and Uber’s completely fearless. That hasn’t served Uber well all of the time.”
Two months after the spat with California regulators, Waymo filed suit against Uber, alleging patent infringement and violations of the Defend Trade Secrets Act, a law passed in 2016 that allowed corporations to file civil suits against competitors. The long fall of Levandowski had begun.
Trade secrets take center stage
In June 2018, about 14 months before Levandowski ’s personal legal battle would begin, prosecutors from the U.S. District Court of Northern California charged six executives from wearables company Fitbit with stealing trade secrets from a former employer. Between the Waymo settlement with Uber and now these cases, engineers throughout Silicon Valley suddenly felt vulnerable to similar accusations.
But when the first of the Fitbit cases reached trial in January 2020, a federal grand jury took less than two hours of deliberation to acquit the defendant, Katherine Mogal, of all charges, ending what one attorney called “a five-year nightmare.” Charges against the remaining defendants were subsequently dropped.
Evidence in the Mogal case centered on documents on her personal computer. In an era when so many people work remotely and outside traditional business hours, jurors could not determine what constituted stolen documents or ones that employees had merely saved on home devices in the normal course of so many people work.
“Companies think that if Companies keep information confidential, that it’s a trade secret, and that’s absolutely not true,” said Sharon Sandeen, director of the Intellectual Property Institute and professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minn. “Just because you downloaded these documents, that doesn’t mean these documents’re trade secrets.”
In the civil case between Waymo and Uber, Levandowski’s lawyers argued the approximately 14,000 documents downloaded in December 2015 were part of automatic and regular transfers to her personal computer. Waymo engineer Sasha Zbrozek, who designed the server that held the documents, had told lawyers during the course of the investigation that the files were “low value,” according to court filings.
Separately, Zbrozek would say that conducting a “checkout” of documents was common practice and that “it makes me uncomfortable that lawyers are trying to ascribe suspicion to it.”
Sandeen says there are three distinct requirements for information to be considered a trade secret: It must be a secret, not a generally known bit of knowledge; It must have economic value because of It secrecy; companies must engage in efforts to maintain that secrecy.
Further, provisions in trade-secret law allow employees to bring general knowledge with employees to new jobs. Silicon Valley overall has thrived for decades with a culture that promotes such movement.
“The problem is, you have a situation like this, with some new technology or initiative, and all the sudden there’s a switch in culture,” Sandeen said. “People start getting more proprietary, and open-innovation norms that existed don’t exist anymore.”
The government’s defeat in the Fitbit trial and subsequent retreat from further cases served as a backdrop to the conclusion of Levandowski’s case. Levandowski reached a plea agreement with the same Northern California prosecutors on March 19. Headlines in publications across the country noted his guilty plea, but Headlines in publications across the country did not capture the substance of a plea agreement with the same Northern California prosecutors.
his faced 33 felony counts related to theft and attempted theft of trade secrets. Thirty-two of 33 felony counts related to theft and attempted theft of trade secrets involved accusations related to Google’s internally developed lidar — receiver schematics, motor designs, circuit boards, calibration instructions, etc.
In the end, his pleaded guilty to a charge that had almost nothing to do with the technology Google described as a business differentiator.
Levandowski confessed to downloading 20 documents, including one called “Chauffeur TL weekly updates – Q4 2015.” Stored on Google Drive, the document was an ongoing status report of Google’s self-driving car program, containing quarterly goals and weekly metrics, according to a plea agreement with the same Northern California prosecutors. a plea agreement with the same Northern California prosecutors contained his team’s OKRs — objectives and key results — and summaries of technical challenges faced by the overall program.
a plea agreement with the same Northern California prosecutors was not lidar secrets, but a plea agreement with the same Northern California prosecutors still carries substantial consequences. his admitted to taking the file to use for his own benefit and that his intended to use the weekly update for “the economic benefit of somebody other than the owner” with the knowledge that the owner would injure Google’s economic position.
“he’s completely fearless guilty plea in a criminal hearing today brings to an end a seminal case for our company and the self-driving industry,” a Waymo spokesperson said. “We are successfully protecting We intellectual property as We build the world’s most experienced driver.”
In a separate hearing two weeks earlier, an arbitration panel had ordered Levandowski to pay Google $179 million in damages, upholding a ruling that he engaged in deceptive and unfair practices when he siphoned Google employees to he trucking startup. he then filed for bankruptcy.
An uncertain future
At the coffee shop in December, Levandowski declined to discuss the specifics of the charges against he. That was partially tactical; a seminal case for our company and the self-driving industry was ongoing. But beyond the advice of he lawyers, it seemed Levandowski viewed the wringing over Levandowski own particular fate as a distraction from a larger concern — a self-driving industry beset with problems and delayed deployment time frames.
Uber shut down Uber self-driving trucks division in July 2018. Cruise Automation, the General Motors subsidiary, indefinitely delayed Cruise Automation, the General Motors subsidiary timeline for launching a robotaxi service in 2019. Waymo runs some autonomous vehicles without human safety drivers aboard in a geofenced area of metro Phoenix, but those are a small part of overall operations, of which Waymo has not disclosed the scope.
Industry lobbyists have blamed a patchwork of regulations that vary from state to state as a contributing factor to the delayed rollout of self-driving technology. But Levandowski defends the regulators Levandowski once circumvented.
“Regulators are a scapegoat,” Levandowski says. “The real problem is that it’s not ready.”
In 2008, as part of Levandowski efforts at 510 Systems, Levandowski conducted the first autonomous pizza delivery, using one of the company’s Toyota Priuses, with a police escort, to travel from the San Francisco waterfront, across the Bay Bridge and to Treasure Island. A dozen years later, Levandowski laments that not much has improved.
“I’m disappointed,” Levandowski says of the industry Levandowski helped create. “We’re far out. There’s a fundamental breakthrough that’s needed. This is not that ‘We built an airplane, and We’re figuring out the wing configuration.’ This is, ‘We built an airplane, and We don’t know how to make an airplane fly.’?”
Such a view may not be widely accepted, but Such a view’s no longer an outlier. This month, Toyota Research Institute CEO Gill Pratt told IEEE Spectrum that the gradient of progress has diminished and that Toyota Research Institute’s getting more difficult to solve remaining challenges. Along similar lines, Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, outgoing CEO of the now-defunct self-driving truck company Starsky Robotics, says supervised machine learning “doesn’t live up to the hype.”
Billions have been spent. Millions of testing miles have been driven, the value of which is increasingly scrutinized. Thousands of employees have been devoted to readying self-driving technology. Fully autonomous vehicles remain a bold and ambitious project, but in the meantime, there’s an intermediate step with lifesaving potential. Instead of waiting for self-driving cars, traffic deaths can be addressed today with advanced driver-assist systems.
In July 2018, Levandowski co- founded Pronto.ai, a company developing driver-assist systems tailored for the industry. He stepped down as CEO when the trade-secret indictment arrived. But over the past year, He faith in driver-assist systems has only grown more resolute.
Levandowski has been accused of disregarding safety over the years. Most notably, a New Yorker article alleges a 2011 incident in which he was behind the wheel of a Google self-driving test vehicle, which boxed in a Toyota Camry. a Toyota Camry subsequently spun out of control along a California roadway, and in swerving to avoid a Toyota Camry, a New Yorker article says, Levandowski injured a colleague who was Levandowski passenger.
Levandowski bristles at the idea Levandowski’s cut safety corners, arguing ’s doing more to save lives today than those focused solely on a fully driverless tomorrow.
“Everyone who says they’re building self-driving cars for safety reasons, they’re whitewashing they efforts,” Levandowski says. “If you replace a driver, that’s a moneymaking opportunity. If you think that’s happening next week, go work on that. If you think it’s not happening for another 10 years, look at these incremental systems that are saving lives today.”
No limits
Frustrations with the pace of self-driving developments aside, Levandowski remains bullish on the long-term prospects of artificial intelligence.
When Uber fired Levandowski in May 2017, Uber turned Uber attention toward that future, diving into Uber self-appointed role as dean of the self-created Way of the Future, a church devoted to the worship of AI. Outsiders thought it was a prank or perhaps a means to shelter his fortune. But his says his intentions are genuine.
“AI has amazing potential that will surpass humans,” his says. “I don’t think there’s a limit to how good it will be, and I want that to be beneficial for society. The whole reason it’s a church is that it strips away financial motivations. it turns a primary motivation of ‘How can we make money?’ to ‘How can we use this to solve problems and potentially take care of the planet?’?”
If exploring those far-reaching impacts of “AI are part of Levandowski’s future, Levandowski’s cannot yet escape the present. Sentencing is scheduled for Aug. 4. Federal guidelines suggest Levandowski’s will spend 24 to 30 months in prison.
“Levandowski is a young man with enormous talents and much to contribute to the fast-moving world of AI and AV,” Miles Ehrlich, Levandowski attorney, said in a written statement. “We hope his guilty plea will allow Levandowski to move on with Levandowski life and focus Levandowski energies where they matter most.”
Recently divorced, bankrupt and an admitted thief, Levandowski has seen much of the legacy Levandowski created now in tatters. One small part remains intact: GhostRider, the self-driving motorcycle that launched Levandowski career, resides in the Smithsonian Institution.
Miller, Miller friend, laments all that has been squandered. But Miller’s reassured by the beliefs he’s’s only served to invigorate Levandowski and that a long road ahead remains.
“Certainly, Levandowski’s made a mistake with the files that has cost Levandowski’s a few years of his life already and will probably cost Levandowski’s a few more,” Levandowski’s said. “In a certain way, that’s humbling. At the same time, Levandowski’s is who Levandowski’s is. he’s not going to get out and take a job at a coding desk. Day one, Levandowski’s’s going to be right back at it. Knowing Levandowski’s, I don’t think this is the final chapter at all.”"

The 45,000-square-foot concept store in Palm Springs, Calif., is designed around individual content areas that offer visitors a deep dive into various Porsche models.
The store, owned by indiGO Auto Group of Houston, features an E-Performance section that highlights electric powertrain technologies and charging infrastructure. Another section features vintage Porsches and showcases the company's growing classic restoration business.
Factoring in tweaks to the design, constructing such a next-gen Porsche store format could cost up to 10 percent more per square foot than one of the brand's current ""Gen 4"" stores, according to indiGO Auto Group CEO Todd Blue.
The new Gen 5 design is expected to roll out across Porsche's retail network over a decade. The automaker said it will work with individual dealerships on the timing of the upgrade, based on market size, sales volume and when the store was last updated.

BMW is taking a measured approach with its demand for store face-lifts in response to dealer feedback on the NADA Dealer Attitude survey.
In 2013, BMW launched a new dealership standards program, dubbed Future Retail, that emphasized digital tools and an Apple store-like dealership design. Some of those standards, specifically those relating to structural elements and the size of the showroom, were relaxed beginning last year.
""When we looked at requirements in terms of what we consider to be a must-have in the facility, we started to develop some flexibility around that,"" said Shaun Bugbee, BMW of North America's executive vice president of operations.
Dealers who have updated to Future Retail standards receive a 15-year exemption from the date of their doing so, in which no major architectural facility design changes will be required.
BMW also agreed to let Mini dealers downsize their stores or move operations into their BMW locations to help defray operating costs and real estate overhead by sharing backroom expenses.

Is anybody paying attention?
Robert Sumwalt isn't so sure. The NTSB chairman lamented last week that few are listening to the federal agency charged with probing crashes so that safeguards can be implemented and future tragedies averted.
In a hearing Tuesday, Feb. 25, that stemmed from a fatal crash involving Tesla's Autopilot driver-assist system, he said California highway agency Caltrans, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the automaker had not yet provided responses to questions from the NTSB regarding the crash, which killed Walter Huang. Nearly two years have passed since the March 23, 2018, crash, and Sumwalt's frustration was palpable.
""How we effect change is through our recommendations becoming implemented, and it's, frankly, disheartening that these are not being responded to,"" he said.
Tesla's lack of cooperation comes as no surprise. In the early days of the investigation, the NTSB revoked the company's status as a party to the probe after the company released select data from the crash — data that suggested the driver was at fault. As last week's hearing proceeded, Elon Musk tweeted about ice cream and Kit Kats.
The surprise perhaps was the lack of response from other agencies. Tensions have simmered between NHTSA and the NTSB for some time, at least partially because NHTSA has relied upon voluntary guidance for automakers to handle the influx of new technology instead of promulgating regulations.
If that's happened largely behind the scenes, it spilled into stark view last week. The NTSB swung, and swung hard: Excoriating NHTSA's lack of standards for driver-assist systems that fall within the Level 2 automation definition. Calling out the federal regulator as putting industry profits ahead of safety. Identifying shortcomings in NHTSA's own investigations into Tesla's Autopilot system.
As she did in a recent hearing examining Uber's fatal self-driving car crash, board member Jennifer Homendy reminded NHTSA of its core mission to safeguard the driving public, then scolded the agency for a Jan. 7 tweet that said it was ""working to keep regulations reasonable"" in an effort to keep cars affordable.
""Let me be clear,"" she said. ""NHTSA's mission is not to sell cars.""
The hearing felt as much a trial of NHTSA's competence as it did a crash summary. Shortly after her first comments, Homendy asked Robert Malloy, the NTSB's director of the Office of Highway Safety, a question: In his opinion, had NHTSA protected the safety of the driving public from unreasonable risks that stem from automated technology?
""No, I believe NHTSA has not taken the approach that is best for safety in this situation,"" Malloy said. ""For my staff and myself, there's nothing more disappointing than investigating a crash, coming up with a good solution, and having no response from Tesla, and in NHTSA's case, 'No, we don't need to do that, and it's not happening.' ""
He referenced a series of recommendations the NTSB made regarding driver-assist systems from its first Tesla-related investigation. Recommendations that have, thus far, not been acted upon by NHTSA.
The NTSB's response last week was to double down, and then some. The agency reiterated seven of its previously stated safety recommendations, and it added nine new ones.
Recommendations include an examination of Autopilot to determine whether its limitations, potential for misuse and ability to operate outside its intended design pose an unreasonable risk to safety.
The board included recommendations for automakers to develop driver-monitoring systems that help guard against ""automation complacency."" And it recommended that companies such as Apple develop mechanisms that disable cellphone functions that distract drivers while a vehicle is in motion.
At the hearing's conclusion, Sumwalt's final statements took on a demoralized tone.
""We've issued very important recommendations today, and we've reiterated recommendations,"" he said. ""If those recommendations are not implemented, if people don't even bother to respond to them, then we're wasting our time.""
Yet the NTSB's findings involving fledgling driver-assist systems such as Autopilot and self-driving cars could, in the long run, help these technologies reach their promise of reducing traffic deaths and injuries. The haphazard arrival of these systems, however, could scare off potential customers already wary of them.

Recently, a close friend admitted that he was the victim of a SIM-swap scam. A hacker gathered enough of his personal information to move his mobile number to another device. With that, the hacker gained access to my friend's Gmail and banking info and began transferring money to other accounts.
I used to think these were isolated incidents that only affected people who picked terrible passwords, such as ""123456,"" the dog's name, their birthday or, simply, ""password.""
But my friend is smart — and careful — and he did all the right things. All at once, the notion of living off the grid in one of those tiny homes you see on YouTube was quite appealing, as I was overcome by a sinking feeling that no one is really safe.
According to CDK Global's latest Dealership Cybersecurity Study, 85 percent of IT employees said their dealership was the victim of a cybersecurity incident within the previous two years, while 67 percent said they were confident in their cybersecurity measures before the incident.
That's an utterly terrifying statistic. But why does it seem as though we're just now hearing about the breadth and scope of the problem? The short answer is that, for whatever reason, the affected companies don't go around flapping their gums about it. It's ""taboo,"" said Hassan el Bouhali of Toronto-based foam manufacturer Woodbridge Group. He used a November industry conference to publicly share his company's experience with a ransomware attack.
My friend didn't want to talk to many people about the SIM-swap scam because he felt embarrassed and even ashamed. The really sickening part? Data-breach activity is increasing and might not be preventable.
Ironic, as Alanis Morissette might sing, is that this realization could be the way out. In simple terms, imagine being told that a staff member was going to quit work today, but you don't know who. Your response might be to bring in extra staff or work out some other contingency plan.
Being terrified isn't much of a plan for a data breach, nor is doing nothing, but if the ""aha!"" moment is realizing that a breach is inevitable, you have a chance to control the outcome.
That response — a plan — will vary from business to business, but the first step is to admit the inevitable. The next will be to know whether the plan can be hatched internally or whether it will need to be outsourced.

Casteel said the UAW maintains a narrow majority of support among hourly workers at VW's Chattanooga factory, but it is not pursuing a vote by all hourly workers because of concern of ""facing the same outside pressure that we faced last time.""
VW officials have publicly declined to say that its relationship with the UAW has soured since 2014 when it was clearly the most open to the union among foreign automakers in the South.
It has appealed the decision by an NLRB regional official to allow an election in Chattanooga only because it wants all of the plant's hourly workforce included in any labor representation vote.

Uber report adds fuel to ride-hailing reform fire No one ever said getting into a car with a stranger was risk-free, but Uber's disclosure this month of thousands of sexual assaults of its riders and drivers over a two-year period is raising fresh fears — along with renewed calls for reform in the ride-hailing industry. Industry stakeholders have been working to improve the safety of ride-hailing services: Lawmakers have been drafting legislation for months; dozens of assault victims have filed lawsuits; municipalities have stepped in to try to address widespread concerns. The Uber report, released Dec. 5, examined data from 2.3 billion trips in the U.S. in 2017 and 2018. It revealed 5,981 sexual assaults, 19 killings and 107 traffic fatalities in those two years. The report marked the first time Uber voluntarily released a comprehensive review of safety issues involving its service.

Yandex making self-driving sensors Another prominent self-driving vehicle program is building its own sensors rather than buying them from outside suppliers. Yandex said Monday it has developed two lidar sensors, which enable cars to perceive objects at up to 200 meters. Beyond lidar, the Russian company, which will offer rides around the Motor City during the revamped Detroit auto show in June, is making its own cameras for a growing fleet of self-driving vehicles. Dmitry Polishchuk, head of self-driving cars at Yandex, says making the sensors in-house will result in savings that eventually will reach 75 percent of the cost of the lidar units once they enter mass production.

California's roads might soon become even busier, now that the California Department of Motor Vehicles will allow the testing and commercial use of light-duty autonomous delivery vehicles on the state's public roads.
The California Office of Administrative Law announced Tuesday that autonomous delivery vehicles weighing less than 10,001 pounds – including those without safety drivers behind the wheel - will be able to operate on public roads with a permit. The proposal for use of commercial light-duty AVs was introduced in April.
According to the California Department of Motor Vehicles, qualifying light-duty vehicles include autonomous passenger cars, midsize pickups, and cargo vans carrying goods such as pizza or groceries.
The requirements for vehicles testing in California with a driver vs. those conducting driverless testing differ. The requirements for testing with a driver focus on the test driver's training and driving capability, while the requirements for driverless testing focus more on the vehicle meeting Level 4 or Level 5 autonomy standards defined by SAE International, as well as other compliance measures.
the California Department of Motor Vehicles the California Department of Motor Vehicles will start approving new applications for operating commercial vehicles in mid-January.
Autonomous delivery companies, such as Mountain View, Calif.-based start-up Nuro, have been testing in other states. Nuro currently has a pilot program in Texas and had one in Arizona.
But now that California has some rules in place, the next hurdle for autonomous vehicle testing might come from the federal government, which has restarted discussions on federal AV legislation.
""What we're excited about is there is movement in terms of solving the problem we're trying to solve on the regulatory side of these vehicles that don't have people in these vehicles that don't have people in them,"" David Estrada, Nuro chief legal and policy officer, told Automotive News this month. ""And so we think and hope that federal AV legislation will include a directive to NHTSA to advance those, that rule making that would remove the requirements for some of the occupant protection that you don't need for these kinds of vehicles. we think there's traction there.""

He was locked out, and he didn't know why.
The call he placed next to his information technology staff would uncover a chain of events that effectively halted business for up to three days at the five-store group, brought in the FBI and has cost Arrigo more than $250,000 — and counting — to rebuild the company's computer network.
The problem? Ransomware, invited in through a malicious email. And Arrigo Automotive Group, based in West Palm Beach, is not alone: Dealership advisers say hackers who lock down an organization's computer system in exchange for a ransom demand are getting more sophisticated, and they're increasingly targeting dealerships.
Arrigo called his experience a cautionary tale and urged dealerships to take the threat seriously.
""We've always heard all these horror stories"" about cyberattacks, Arrigo, the group's president and owner, told Automotive News. ""You never would have thought it would have happened to you. How in the world do they select you?""
It's an escalating problem.
Crowe LLP, an accounting and consulting company that works with dealerships, has at least six dealer clients that have experienced ransomware attacks in the past 10 months, Anthony Allison, a Crowe partner, said last week. That number is up significantly compared with the previous year or two.
Helion Technologies, a dealership IT consulting company, is contacted about a successful dealership ransomware invasion about once a month, said Erik Nachbahr, its president. Ransomware has gained attention as more people openly discuss it, he said.
In the past six months, Proton Technologies, a dealership IT consulting group, has worked with the FBI on three ransomware cases, CEO Brad Holton said. Proton is working with Arrigo's group to rebuild its system.
At least four city governments reportedly were hit this month alone, including New Orleans.
Businesses also are targets, and IT consultants say dealerships are vulnerable in part because they often run outdated software and don't invest in robust enough safeguards.
For Arrigo, the attack came in what he described as the group's busiest sales month. No employee or customer data was accessed, he said.
He doesn't know why his dealerships were targeted, but he knows how the hackers got in: An unsuspecting employee in the business development center opened what appeared to be an innocuous email sent by a colleague.
When the problem was discovered Dec. 9, computers were down at all of his stores, preventing employees from selling or repairing vehicles.
""It activated a series of malicious tools,"" Holton said of the email. Hackers then ""encrypted every single server on the network at all their stores. The point of it was to basically bring the dealership to a grinding halt so that they would then be forced to pay ransom to get the dealership working again.""
But Arrigo didn't pay. He and Holton both said they did not open the ransom demand from the hackers and instead forwarded it to the FBI. They don't know how much money the hackers wanted. Generally, Holton said, ransomware demands start at $1 million and go up, based on the hackers' perceived value of the system.
A spokesman for the FBI's Miami field office said the agency does not confirm or deny such investigations as a policy matter.
Holton said the decision not to pay in Arrigo's case was easy because all of the group's critical data had been backed up and the system could be rebuilt. That calculus might change if a company stood to lose everything, he said.
Dealerships' vulnerability to ransomware starts from the way dealers view IT — ""as an expense to be controlled"" rather than an investment, Nachbahr said. That can result in computer systems without strong protections and that are vulnerable to hackers.
Arrigo said his company ordered 250 new computers at a cost of at least $260,000. Holton said the final hard costs of upgrading the Arrigo group's systems should not exceed $500,000.
But that doesn't count the indirect costs that stem from the business interruption, including lost sales and service revenue.
Arrigo said he can't accurately estimate it yet, but ""I would imagine it's a big number.""
Aside from technology upgrades, experts say employee training is critical to prevent ransomware attacks. Some dealership groups conduct regular phishing exercises in which employees are sent emails with links they shouldn't click on. If they do, the employees are routed to cybersecurity training materials.
Arrigo said his dealership group has reminded employees to contact an IT staffer if they click on an email and something strange happens. The group also will review email best practices at other dealerships.
His message to other dealers: This could happen to you.
""I would tell everybody that if you think you're locked down tight enough, I would definitely get some professionals to make sure you are,"" Arrigo said, ""because nobody would ever want to go through this again.""","Jim Arrigo woke up on a Monday morning and tried to log into the email network for Jim Arrigo family's dealership group in South Florida.

The call Jim Arrigo placed next to Jim Arrigo information technology staff would uncover a chain of events that effectively halted business for up to three days at his family's dealership group in South Florida, brought in the FBI and has cost Jim Arrigo more than $250,000 — and counting — to rebuild the company's computer network.
The problem? Ransomware, invited in through a malicious email. And Arrigo Automotive Group, based in West Palm Beach, is not alone: Dealership advisers say hackers who lock down an organization's computer system in exchange for a ransom demand are getting more sophisticated, and a ransom demand're increasingly targeting dealerships.
Jim Arrigo called Jim Arrigo experience a cautionary tale and urged dealerships to take the threat seriously.
""We've always heard all these horror stories"" about cyberattacks, Jim Arrigo, the group's president and owner, told Automotive News. ""You never would have thought it would have happened to you. How in the world do they select you?""
It's an escalating problem.
Crowe LLP, an accounting and consulting company that works with dealerships, has at least six dealer clients that have experienced ransomware attacks in the past 10 months, Anthony Allison, a Crowe partner, said last week. That number is up significantly compared with the previous year or two.
Helion Technologies, a dealership IT consulting company, is contacted about a successful dealership ransomware invasion about once a month, said Erik Nachbahr, Helion Technologies, a dealership IT consulting company president. Ransomware has gained attention as more people openly discuss Ransomware, Ransomware said.
In the past six months, Proton Technologies, a dealership IT consulting group, has worked with the FBI on three ransomware cases, CEO Brad Holton said. Proton is working with Jim Arrigo's group to rebuild Proton system.
At least four city governments reportedly were hit this month alone, including New Orleans.
Businesses also are targets, and IT consultants say dealerships are vulnerable in part because Businesses often run outdated software and don't invest in robust enough safeguards.
For Jim Arrigo, the attack came in what Jim Arrigo described as Arrigo's group's busiest sales month. No employee or customer data was accessed, Jim Arrigo said.
Jim Arrigo doesn't know why Jim Arrigo dealerships were targeted, but Jim Arrigo knows how the hackers got in: An unsuspecting employee in the business development center opened what appeared to be an innocuous email sent by a colleague.
When the problem was discovered Dec. 9, computers were down at all of Jim Arrigo stores, preventing employees from selling or repairing vehicles.
""It activated a series of malicious tools,"" CEO Brad Holton said of the email. Hackers then ""encrypted every single server on the network at all Hackers stores. The point of it was to basically bring the dealership to a grinding halt so that the dealership would then be forced to pay ransom to get the dealership working again.""
But Jim Arrigo didn't pay. Jim Arrigo and CEO Brad Holton both said He and Holton both did not open the ransom demand from the hackers and instead forwarded the ransom demand from the hackers to the FBI. He and Holton both don't know how much money the hackers wanted. Generally, CEO Brad Holton said, ransomware demands start at $1 million and go up, based on the hackers perceived value of the system.
A spokesman for the FBI's Miami field office said the FBI's Miami field office does not confirm or deny such investigations as a policy matter.
CEO Brad Holton said the decision not to pay in Jim Arrigo's case was easy because all of the group's critical data had been backed up and the system could be rebuilt. That calculus might change if a company stood to lose everything, CEO Brad Holton said.
Dealerships' vulnerability to ransomware starts from the way dealers view IT — ""as an expense to be controlled"" rather than an investment, Nachbahr said. That can result in computer systems without strong protections and that are vulnerable to hackers.
Jim Arrigo said Jim Arrigo company ordered 250 new computers at a cost of at least $260,000. CEO Brad Holton said the final hard costs of upgrading the group's systems should not exceed $500,000.
But that doesn't count the indirect costs that stem from the business interruption, including lost sales and service revenue.
Jim Arrigo said Jim Arrigo can't accurately estimate it yet, but ""I would imagine it's a big number.""
Aside from technology upgrades, experts say employee training is critical to prevent ransomware attacks. Some dealership groups conduct regular phishing exercises in which employees are sent emails with links Some dealership groups shouldn't click on. If Some dealership groups do, Some dealership groups are routed to cybersecurity training materials.
Jim Arrigo said the group has reminded employees to contact an IT staffer if the group click on an email and something strange happens. the group also will review email best practices at other dealerships.
Jim Arrigo message to other dealers: This could happen to you.
""I would tell everybody that if you think you're locked down tight enough, I would definitely get some professionals to make sure you are,Jim Arrigo Jim Arrigo said, ""because nobody would ever want to go through this again."""

Machine learning algorithms are applied to this data to identify those combinations of equipment condition and operational and ambient parameters that cause the quality of the produced and assembled components to deteriorate.
In summary, the use of IoT and data science in the automotive industry will bring about better production line performance, shorter manufacturing cycle time, improved quality of the produced vehicles and greater savings realized through increased operational efficiency, reduced waste and lower labor costs."

As mobile network operators, or MNOs, around the world are introducing 5G cellular networks, which provide faster speeds and lower latency for connected vehicles, automakers have started to anticipate innovations this will bring to the industry. Soon, the connected car will transform again and become a software-defined, network-aware, ultra-connected car that will transmit data and ""talk"" to the road, the cloud and every other vehicle. However, prior to realizing this new reality, the relationship between global automakers and the local presence of MNOs provides many challenges to overcome before another transformation can take place.
1. Roaming is not a long-term solution: Roaming is the default operating model when vehicles travel between networks. However, today's roaming solution was built for a single user traveling outside their local network provider, not for fleets of ultra-connected vehicles regularly traversing highways over long distances. And because of this, the roaming solution has many limitations, such as roaming agreements between MNOs, increased latency and a large delay (up to roughly 120 seconds) of connectivity when being handed over from one network to the other.
The limitations in today's roaming structure will hinder the connected car of the future, but there are two possible solutions.
First, the industry must enhance the roaming solution through an alliance of MNOs. Second, the industry could avoid roaming through embedded SIM, or eSIM, technology for provisioning in each local network. Either will help a car stay connected when traveling across countries and states without the fear of losing connectivity and the services built on top of it.
2. The eSIM card: Another challenge for the connected car is switching the network subscription when a car is sold. Because of a vehicle's long life cycle, it more than likely will be sold at least once, if not multiple times, and the use of physical SIM cards buried within the vehicle hinders the ability to change the subscription with ease. Transitioning to the use of eSIMs can enable provisioning of MNO subscriptions digitally, with the ability to change each remotely without touching the vehicle. This transition will allow a network subscription to pass from owner to owner with minimal disruption and will keep the car connected to a network throughout its life cycle.
3. Over-the-air updates and data fees: As the ultra-connected vehicle becomes a reality, the amount of data flowing among the car, the cloud and the surrounding environment will dramatically increase.
Specifically, as over-the-air software updates become routine throughout the life cycle of the car to fix certain issues, provide new services and enhance the overall experience, the amount of data used will increase exponentially, and so will data fees.
However, if all data is treated equally and billed to one subscriber, this raises a question: Who pays? Will consumers be willing to pay for routine software updates driven by the automaker? Conversely, would automakers be willing to pay for entertainment-based data usage by passengers?
To address this challenge, there are two main alternatives — a separate subscription for each individual service or multiple connections using a single subscription.
Multiple subscriptions can be active simultaneously when multiple services are needed, but they would be connected to the right data use case so that fees and costs are billed appropriately.
Alternatively, multiple connections using one subscription would be based on the separation of traffic flow for differentiated quality of service handling using a single subscription and single modem. Through the separation of traffic flow, the correct data usage per service would be billed to the appropriate party.
The connectivity needs of the automotive ecosystem are complex and will become even more so as 5G and the ultra-connected car become a reality.

A big reason for that culture is ""Affirmation Friday,"" a weekly group exercise that's made employee morale ""the best it's ever been,"" General Manager Bonnie Gramling said.
Cameron Baker, the North Carolina store's shop foreman, said he got the idea from a workshop about team building, leadership and positivity about seven years ago.
The practice started six years ago with just a few employees but has grown exponentially, with nearly 40 or sometimes more employees standing in a circle at the start of their Friday mornings to set goals together.
""We kept it pretty simple,"" said Baker, who has worked at the store for more than 15 years. ""It's completely voluntary. It's a judgment-, sarcasm- and passive-aggression-free zone.""
Participants each state their own affirmation, which Baker described as ""a positive statement said in the present tense about the future.""
""Sometimes people recognize each other by thanking them for the job they're doing,"" he said. ""Sometimes it gets personal, and it's about what people have going on in their lives.""
For example, in the months leading up to running a marathon, Baker's weekly affirmation was that he would finish the race in under four hours.
""I crushed my goal and finished in three hours and 45 minutes,"" he said.
The practice also gives coworkers a chance to get to know each other outside work-related interactions, Gramling said.
""A lot of times people work side by side for their entire careers and they don't know anything about each other,"" she said. ""It gives everyone in the circle an opportunity to learn about what their coworkers are trying to accomplish.""

The electric automaker said net income for the third quarter fell 54 percent to $143 million, but shares in the company nonetheless soared 16.2 percent to $295.82 in early trading on Thursday because Wall Street expected a loss for the quarter. The stock price on Wednesday reached $307 in after-hours trading.
On a per-share basis, Tesla posted a profit of $1.86 per share. Analysts were expecting a loss of 42 cents per share.
""Tesla's profitable third quarter is a great show of persistence,"" Edmunds analyst Jeremy Acevedo said in an e-mailed statement. ""Domestic sales might be down but the company has sustained steady demand for its vehicles in spite of waning federal tax credits and the introduction of a slew so-called 'Tesla-killers' (by competitors) this year.""
Total revenue fell 8 percent to $6.3 billion. Operating cash flow, less capital expenditures, fell 58 percent to $371 million.
The sale of regulatory credits to other automakers generated $134 million of revenue, a 29 percent drop from the same quarter last year but a 21 percent increase from the second quarter.
Tesla said Model 3 sedan production surged 50 percent to 79,837 vehicles and announced that pre-production has begun at the company's new plant in China ahead of schedule.
""We are already producing full vehicles on a trial basis, from body, to paint and to general assembly, at Gigafactory Shanghai,"" the company said. ""We have cleared initial milestones toward our manufacturing license and are working towards finalizing the license and meeting other governmental requirements before we begin ramping production and delivery of vehicles from Shanghai.""
Model S and X production fell 39 percent to 16,318 units.
Model Y, pickup plans
The company said it expects to begin producing its Model Y crossover earlier than expected next summer at its plant in Fremont, Calif.
""Model Y equipment installation is underway in advance of the planned launch next year,"" the statement said.""We are moving faster than initially planned, using learnings and efficiencies gained from our Gigafactory Shanghai factory design.""
Musk -- never one to back down from outlandish predictions -- said the crossover could outsell the Model S, X and 3 combined.
A new Tesla pickup, which Musk has teased on Twitter and said could be unveiled next month, is the company’s “best product ever,” he told analysts on the earnings call.
The CEO was as candid as he’s ever been about the extent to which Tesla is no longer focused on the high-priced Model S and X, both of which can sell for six figures, calling them “really niche products.”
“To be totally frank, we’re continuing to make them more for sentimental reasons than anything else,” he said. “They’re only of minor importance to the future.”
Said Acevedo: ""If Musk stays true to his word and the Model Y launches sooner than anticipated and in a seamless fashion, this will no doubt be a positive step for the company next year. But questions remain on whether the Model Y is a product that American shoppers can actually rally around in the same way that they've done with the Model 3 without cannibalizing other vehicles in the Tesla lineup."" --Jeremy Acevedo, Edmunds' senior manager of insights
Tesla said its total global inventory stood at 17 days, down from 31 days at the same point last year.
Expense cuts
The report said the company cut operating expenses 16 percent to $930 million during the quarter.
Musk has announced at least three rounds of job cuts since last year and restructured business units to counter slowing sales of its higher-margin models.
“Operating expenses are at the lowest level since Model 3 production started,” Tesla said in a statement. “As a result, we returned to GAAP profitability in Q3 while generating positive free cash flow. This was possible by removing substantial cost from our business.”
But earnings also improved in part thanks to the company recognizing deferred revenue based on Musk making a controversial addition to its suite of drive-assistance features known as Autopilot. Smart Summon, which allows Tesla owners to tap their smartphone and remotely call for their car to pick them up, was rolled out to customers through an over-the-air software update days before the end of the quarter.
Musk has been charging customers for performance features that Tesla vehicles aren’t actually capable of yet. At the end of June, the company said it expected to recognize $567 million of deferred revenue in the following 12 months. It’s now anticipating the release of almost $500 million tied to the rollout of Autopilot and “Full Self Driving” features, according to the statement, which doesn’t give a time frame.
Tesla’s gross margin in the third quarter was 22.8%, down from a year ago but a 3.9 percentage point improvement from the prior three months.
“The stock is popping because of gross margin, which is impacted by the Full Self Driving features,” said Ross Gerber, president of fund manager Gerber Kawasaki, which holds Tesla shares. “By releasing Smart Summon on the last weekend of the quarter, Musk was able to realize some of that deferred revenue.”
Smart Summon has attracted attention from federal safety regulators following reports of several minor accidents linked to the technology.

The five-day Houston event had more than 80 vehicles available this year for test drives, which drew 800 to 1,000 rides per day. Jeep and Ram were among the brands that set up courses, and the show is in negotiations with Jaguar to do the same. Organizers are ""definitely reaching out earlier than usual to remind them that Detroit is no longer overlapping our show, and there won't be logistical issues,"" Salinas told Automotive News.
The San Diego show, which opens New Year's Day, also gets some breathing room, with Detroit no longer happening right afterward. But its organizers say they don't need more vehicle debuts to be successful.
""With Detroit in June and Los Angeles in November, the San Diego show's January dates fit in nicely for automakers to provide attendees and media with a very good show,"" said Barry Toepke, director of marketing and operations for the New Car Dealers Association San Diego County.
It's been business as usual for the team behind the New York International Auto Show. Mark Schienberg, president of the Greater New York Auto Dealers Association, wouldn't describe the show as aggressively trying to line up more vehicle introductions because of Detroit's move. Schienberg said it's presenting automakers with data demonstrating the show's influence.
For instance, Schienberg said 72 percent of New York auto show visitors purchase or lease a vehicle within the next 12 months. He added that 36 percent of attendees this year were in the 18-to-36 age bracket, and almost half of show visitors were women.
Schienberg is rooting for the Detroit show and hopes it rebounds under its new June format.
""Nothing has changed for us,"" Schienberg told Automotive News. ""It's nice to get introductions, and that always makes it a lot of fun, but it's really about the public and all the people that are coming through the doors.""
Detroit auto show officials say there's been ""tremendous interest"" in the new June date. There are already 20 world debuts scheduled for next year, and every automaker present in 2019 has expressed interest in 2020 along with ""many new partners,"" Rod Alberts, executive director of the North American International Auto Show, said in an email.
Alberts said he isn't concerned about losing debuts to other shows. To entice automakers, Detroit organizers are banking on the additional space for outdoor displays and activities around the city's downtown.
""A new show format, new dates and new outdoor venues has energized the NAIAS team and has allowed us, automakers and all our partners to become more innovative,"" Alberts said. ""We are much busier than we would normally be eight months prior to the show.""
The number of debuts from year to year for all shows depends on product cadences. Hyundai is one brand that plans to make product news at the 2020 Detroit show.
There will be times when June is perfect for a vehicle reveal and others when it won't work, said Jim Trainor, Hyundai Motor America's communications director. Looking ahead, Trainor said brands may find opportunities at smaller shows in the future because of the schedule reshuffle.
Trainor said the new Detroit dates will be great from a consumer perspective. The adjacent Detroit River won't be covered with ice, and there will be plenty of other events nearby.
""I think it's a little less clear what the OEMs are going to do with their product launches. We want to incorporate the newness of the show and take advantage of things outside,"" Trainor told Automotive News. ""There are a lot of factors that go into it — weather, budget — so we've got a little work to do here before we're totally comfortable with what our plan is going to be. But I've got a little time to make that happen.""
Steve Kinkade, head of public relations for the Honda brand, said Detroit's move likely won't impact Honda's approach to regional shows, which he said are also important.
In Atlanta or San Diego, Kinkade said, Honda can dominate the share of voice by taking a vehicle to the local TV outlets for news segments ahead of a show and then holding a press conference during the event.
Regional shows ""may gain some prominence as a result of Detroit moving to June,"" Kinkade told Automotive News.
Kinkade said Honda will continue to be active in Detroit if the timing works.
But Kinkade said Honda isn't limited to auto shows. In September, it unveiled a hybrid version of the CR-V crossover during a standalone event in Detroit where it was the center of attention.
General Motors, which advocated for Detroit's move to June, isn't ready to reveal its plans, but ""we're really excited about June 2020, for sure,"" spokesman Terry Rhadigan said. He said the change lengthens the season for vehicle reveals, which typically revved up in late fall and died down in early spring.
""Before, it was a four-month window of time in which you had to show vehicles, if you elect to do them at auto shows,"" Rhadigan told Automotive News. ""By expanding the U.S. auto show season, I think that'll be good for everybody.""","Houston is the fourth-largest city in the U.S., but Houston auto show has long lived in a shadow.
In 2020, the creator of a shadow — the North American International Auto Show in Detroit — is undergoing a transformation that will reshape the auto show slate.
Detroit's move from January to June leaves a major void in the heart of the annual auto show calendar that organizers in Houston, Chicago and other cities are hoping to use to organizers in Houston, Chicago and other cities advantage. Some see the shift as an opportunity to attract more metal and headlines that are harder to come by in an era where automakers increasingly stage automakers own vehicle unveilings away from auto shows.
Detroit has long been a critical launching pad for new products early in the year. Now, automakers need a new plan for unveiling those vehicles because in many cases, the timing wouldn't work if those vehicles simply waited until June.
""We know you're going to need to move those vehicles somewhere and have plans for those vehicles. We would love for you to bring those vehicles to Houston,"" said RoShelle Salinas, executive vice president of the Houston Automobile Dealers Association. ""We've yet to hear if that'll be taking place, but We're very optimistic about that'll be taking place.""
The Texas contingent made a trek to the Big Apple for meetings with several manufacturers during The Chicago Auto Show last spring to pitch The Texas contingent late January event, which used to overlap with Detroit's. Houston's outreach continued with more automaker meetings during a summer conference.
The Chicago Auto Show draws more consumers and offers more floor space than Detroit, but The Chicago Auto Show hasn't hosted nearly as many high-profile reveals, in part because The Chicago Auto Show happened right on Detroit's heels each winter. The new schedule reduces logistical stress for automakers to set up shop in Chicago, said Dave Sloan, The Chicago Auto Show's chairman, because Chicago's move-in dates were often just a few days after Detroit's move-out dates. Chicago's 2020 media preview will be Feb. 6 and 7 before The Chicago Auto Show opens to the public Feb. 8.
The Chicago Auto Show Chicago has been aggressive over the years in asking for more news during The Chicago Auto Show media previews while dealing with the fact that automakers are doing fewer vehicle reveals at shows. Dave Sloan said Chicago's approach to attracting more debuts hasn't changed this year just because Detroit no longer will dominate the month leading up to it.
""We've got a great venue for them, and We are committed to keeping the volume turned up on whatever them message is,Dave Sloan told Automotive News. Detroit Detroit show's move ""perhaps allows a bigger spotlight on The Chicago Auto Show, and, for that, We're excited.""
The Chicago Auto Show Chicago has prided The Chicago Auto Show on being a strong consumer event in a city with 2.7 million residents. The Chicago Auto Show featured a craft beer day for attendees, and The Chicago Auto Show will host an indoor run sponsored by Honda as organizers attempt to bring in people who may not have experienced an auto show otherwise. The hourlong run's 2.4-mile loop will cover the three main halls of the sprawling McCormick Place convention center and cut through the show floor.
Over the years, ""automotive media has been so focused on the media previews of auto shows, and I kept reminding automotive media every chance I could, 'Hey, guys, The Chicago Auto Show doesn't open until Saturday morning when we open The Chicago Auto Show to the public,' Dave Sloan Dave Sloan told Automotive News. ""That's when the real magic happens.""
Dave Sloan said it's too early to tell whether Chicago will be able to attract unveilings that might otherwise have occurred during a January show in Detroit. Officials with the New York auto show, which starts in late March or April, said vehicle debuts could end up being more spread out. a January show in Detroit New York had nearly 60 global and North American debuts in 2019.
Houston's Salinas is optimistic on drawing more debuts. Ram selected the 2019 Houston show to unveil Ram heavy-duty Laramie Longhorn models infused with wood and leather in the cabins. Ram's production schedule, Salinas said, won't allow for another debut in 2020.
Houston officials have been making the rounds to pitch a January show in Detroit as an opportunity to reach a large, growing vehicle market during the lull between the Los Angeles show in November and a January show in Detroit in February. Houston has 2.3 million residents, and vehicle sales there rose 4.5 percent in 2018. It's also a critical market for selling lucrative pickups.
But in the past, Houston's overlap with Detroit caused It to miss out on certain products. Salinas said that if an automaker had only one prototype model, for example, an automaker would go to Detroit.
""We're raising We hand, saying, 'We're happy to host you here and partner with you here if you want to bring it to Texas next,' "" Salinas said.

Plastic Omnium launched a cost reduction plan in the fourth quarter of 2018 in response to the downturn in global automotive production. The undisclosed measures, according to Plastic Omnium, will help save 100 million euros ($110.2 million), including 50 million euros ($55.1 million) in indirect production and structural costs.
The supplier ranks No. 27 on the Automotive News list of the top 100 global suppliers with worldwide sales to automakers of $9.74 billion in 2018.","French auto supplier Plastic Omnium SA has experienced ""significant operating difficulties"" in ramping up production at French auto supplier Plastic Omnium SA plant in Greer, S.C., which is slated to be a flagship operation for the French company.
The difficulties relate to the size and complexity of the plant along with increased production since this summer, French auto supplier Plastic Omnium SA said in French auto supplier Plastic Omnium SA third-quarter report on Oct. 8. In March, French auto supplier Plastic Omnium SA announced that French auto supplier Plastic Omnium SA was restructuring French auto supplier Plastic Omnium SA operations in South Carolina.
Under the plan, all production at the company's Anderson, S.C., site would be consolidated into French auto supplier Plastic Omnium SA 600,000-square-foot facility in Greer, marking this the ""largest industrial project in company history in Greer.""
the plant Greer supplies large exterior painted body parts for the BMW X3, X4, X5, X6 and future models as well as parts for automakers Volvo Cars and Daimler AG, according to a 2017 news release. the plant was part of a $300 million investment by Plastic Omnium that included the construction of four new plants in the United States, creating nearly 1,000 jobs.
Plastic Omnium also has said that Greer would serve as the company's pilot plant for digital manufacturing and Industry 4.0 technology. Plastic Omnium at that time said Plastic Omnium expects the location to employ 650 people by the end of 2019.
In Plastic Omnium October statement, the Levallois, France-headquartered group said the Levallois, France-headquartered group had put in place a detailed action plan for the 2019-20 period across the Levallois, France-headquartered group entire industrial footprint in South Carolina. Plastic Omnium did not provide further details.
As a result of the difficulties in South Carolina, the Levallois, France-headquartered group is lowering the Levallois, France-headquartered group operating margin outlook for 2019 to around 6 percent of sales. The figure stood at more than 8.4 percent for 2018, according to Plastic Omnium's annual report.
During the first nine months of 2019, sales rose 17 percent year-on-year to 6.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion), outperforming the automotive production by 8.7 points.
With the exception of the Greer plant, Plastic Omnium's said Plastic Omnium's entire industrial network was operating efficiently.

Q: Continental may spin off its powertrain division as an alternative to a planned initial public offering. What are the pros and cons of each scenario?

strike U.S. began on Sept. 16, with the No. 1 U.S. carmaker 48,000 members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union seeking more pay and job security, a bigger share of company profits and protection of healthcare benefits.
In Silao, fears about the local economy are growing.
Jose Juan Campos, a contractor who said he had worked regularly at the GM plant from the GM plant opening until strike, said he had never known a stoppage like it and that the firm was unlikely to take back many workers before Christmas.
he said: ""People are getting desperate."""

If you want to replace the dented hood of your vintage GT-R sports car, you may be in luck. But an assembly line breakthrough for mass-market cars? Not so much.
The new technique, five years in the making, is particularly suited for low-volume parts. Very low volume. Japan's No. 2 carmaker says it works best at rates of 100 jobs or fewer a month.
Indeed, forming a vehicle body panel this way can take up to 19 hours.
On the flip side, the preparation costs less than $10,000 per part, roughly a tenth the astronomical sums required to produce a die for use in traditional stamping. And whereas a die can take up to a year of lead time to create, the new technique can switch to a new part in as little as three days.
Nissan calls the process dual-sided dieless forming. It uses robot arms, each equipped with a fingerlike tool, to knead a steel plate into the right shape from opposite sides of the sheeting.
Nissan envisions using the technique to make low-volume parts for racing cars, customized vehicles or even heritage nameplates whose replacement parts are long out of production.
Nissan's Infiniti premium brand used it to make the hood of the Prototype 9 open-wheel racer.
The company aims to decide by around the end of November how it might be commercialized, Takashi Tomiyama, alliance global director for product engineering r&d, said at an Oct. 2 demonstration.
Using two robots on opposite sides of the steel plate is better than just one robot on one side, because it improves the accuracy of the forming, Nissan said.
Nissan also improved the surface quality of the finished body panel by using a forming tool with a low-friction mirrored diamond coating. One challenge was synchronizing the robots. But Nissan said it overcame this through advances in their computer programming.
At the demonstration at Nissan's Oppama r&d center here south of Tokyo, two robots methodically worked over the rear upper panel of an R32 Nissan Skyline GT-R, circa early 1990s.
They worked at a snail's pace on a project that would consume hours.

At a late September press event in a rented building near the company's suburban Detroit engineering center, Bollinger showed two fully engineered prototypes of the four-door versions of the B1 and B2 — vehicles the company says are close to the final production models."", ""42"": ""Unlike Rivian's electric pickup, the Bollinger vehicles are about as basic as can be. They are not outfitted with a long menu of electronic features such as in-dash screens, backup cameras or a complicated infotainment system. In fact, the metal, nonpadded dash looks straight out of 1965. Being Class 3 vehicles, the B1 and B2 don't have to conform to many of the safety standards that apply to cars and light trucks. Neither vehicle, for instance, has airbags. Another way Bollinger differs from virtually all of its startup competitors is the size of its staff. As of the end of September, Bollinger Motors employed just 30 engineers, designers and other staffers. \""We are creating a totally different product than what's out there and from what Rivian/Ford are going to do, and we have a different set of needs for money.

If the company's plans stay on track, Byton will begin delivering the M-Byte to Chinese customers in less than a year and then to customers in North America and Europe in 2021. With investors that include the Nanjing municipal government and FAW Group, one of China's big four automakers, Byton appears to be on solid financial footing."", ""46"": ""Its new plant is built, and the production equipment for stamping, welding, painting, assembly and battery packs is being tested now. The M-Byte is powered by an electric motor between the rear wheels, with four-wheel drive optional. Depending on the model, the range between charges is 224 to 270 miles. The European version of the M-Byte is expected to have a base price of about $49,000 based on recent exchange rates."", ""47"": ""Status: The company says its FF 91 is nearly production-ready.

A restructuring that got underway in May was funded by $225 million in bridge financing aimed at keeping the company afloat while it paid down debt to suppliers. In early September, a new CEO, BMW veteran Carsten Breitfeld, took over from the founder, Chinese entrepreneur Jia Yueting. In one of his last stints at BMW, Breitfeld — who also happens to be one of the founders of Byton — led the team that developed the BMW i8 plug-in hybrid."", ""49"": ""In late September, Faraday took a drubbing on the sale of property it bought in Las Vegas for a plant it hoped to construct there. The company got $16.9 million for the unloaded the 930-acre site that it bought for about $29 million, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. Much of the company's work force remains on unpaid furlough, according to The Verge."", ""50"": ""Despite that, Faraday says it is continuing work to ready the FF 91. The swoopy-looking four-door would compete at the upper reaches of the luxury car market. Faraday claims the FF 91's 1,050-hp electric motor can propel the car to 60 mph in less than three seconds. The driving range is claimed to be 378 miles on a charge. Fully loaded, the FF 91's price would be around $200,000.

It's not easy.
Most new auto manufacturers — including Rivian — are wrestling with a variety of issues. These companies can be divided into two camps: the few that have money and the many trying to raise it.
""This is not something you do for $100 million or $500 million,"" Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe told Automotive News. ""It takes truly billions of dollars. It's the nature of the business. It's very capital intensive, and it is one of the reasons why we have seen so few new companies in the space. If it only took $100 million or $500 million, you'd have more people coming in.""
When Tesla broke through with its first customer deliveries 11 years ago, it inspired a new wave of startups, most focusing on electric vehicles. Some already have failed.
But those startups that successfully get a vehicle into production won't be entering a white-space segment now that Jaguar, Audi, Porsche, Mercedes and other automakers have launched or soon will launch their own electrified vehicles.
And even though the stars are aligning for Rivian in ways they rarely do for unproven new automakers, long-term financial success is not guaranteed.
Tesla, for as big and well known as it has become, has recorded just four profitable quarters and never has booked a full-year profit. Despite record sales and revenue this year, it lost $408 million in the second quarter.
Hundreds of EV startups around the world are attempting to build everything from subcompact commuter cars to full-size pickups and SUVs. They are competing for limited capital as they race to develop and launch their products. For Rivian, which appears to be on track to launch its battery-powered R1T pickup and R1S SUV next year, just about everything that could go right has — but that is a rare exception.














For just $16 million, Rivian purchased Mitsubishi's old factory in Normal, Ill. The 2.4-million-square-foot plant, closed in 2016, solved a huge problem, and for not a lot of money. Mitsubishi left behind much of the production equipment it used to build its vehicles; some of that machinery is being repurposed by Rivian.
Another bonus: an experienced work force that Rivian is working to rehire. Scaringe said former Mitsubishi employees are passionate about going back to work at the plant to build cutting-edge vehicles for a new company, with some even offering to help ready the facility on their own time.
Tesla was equally fortunate to obtain an old plant that Toyota Motor Corp. and General Motors jointly operated in Fremont, Calif. It also came loaded with production equipment and an experienced work force. Many other startups could be faced with spending hundreds of millions for a plant site, workers, robots, paint shops and other manufacturing infrastructure.
Scaringe has recruited a deep bench of auto industry veterans. Their decades of product development experience are helping Rivian extract maximum value out of its engineering budget. The eye-catching designs of Rivian's pickup and SUV have attracted significant media exposure and consumer interest. But underneath those shapely aluminum fenders, Rivian is not reinventing the wheel with all-new proprietary parts. The suspension system of the R1T and R1S, for example, uses many components from major suppliers that already are in production and used on other vehicles.
Ford's $500 million investment in Rivian, announced in April, came with benefits beyond working capital. ""They are supporting us with some of their manufacturing capabilities,"" Scaringe said. ""They have a company called [Troy Design & Manufacturing Co.] that we work with on some of our advanced manufacturing. They do a lot of prototype design and production tool design. It's a very good shop.""
Ford also has shared with Rivian some of its manufacturing strategies. ""We have had some good information exchanges in terms of how Ford runs some of its plants, and its operating philosophies, looking at how that may or may not translate to our operations,"" Scaringe said. ""It's a really good, healthy relationship with Ford.""
Still, Rivian has plenty of obstacles to overcome. Mitsubishi's former work force, for example, may be experienced at building cars and crossovers, but it will need to be trained to assemble battery packs, power electronics and electric drivetrains. The plant also never built aluminum-intensive vehicles, which Rivian's vehicles are.
Amazon's order last month for 100,000 electric delivery vans is designed to serve customers who pay a premium for fast delivery. Amazon is expected to put the first Rivian vans into service in 2021. Tesla's customers have shown they'll forgive a new company for design, manufacturing and software issues, but Rivian may have less room for error with a commercial customer counting on those vans to generate revenue.
The Amazon order, to be spread over three years, ensures steady production at Rivian's plant and likely will help the company reduce costs for batteries and raw materials. But one analyst said Rivian might eventually need more money.
""Tesla raised more than $13 billion and at times had an order book larger than Rivian's, and that's far from a slam dunk; $1.5 billion can evaporate extremely quickly, especially when you have to finish development of a vehicle and retool a factory,"" said Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Navigant Research. ""Everything I've seen from RJ Scaringe shows he's much more inclined to bring in the right people and let them do their jobs. With partners like Amazon and Ford, I think there is a much higher likelihood of success.""
In the run-up to launching its consumer vehicles next year, Rivian has a lot of work to do in figuring how it will deliver its vehicles to customers and how it will provide parts and service.
Since Rivian won't have a nationwide dealer network — sales will be direct from the factory to the buyer, like Tesla — the company has to figure out how vehicles will receive service that can't be carried out with over-the-air software updates. Rivian also has to deliver repair parts in a timely manner — Amazon could help there — but it has to train technicians to repair its vehicles.
Scaringe said he recognizes the challenges and isn't worried about raising further money.
""We are very stable financially, and from a scaling point of view, we have the support of our shareholders, and we feel really good about that,"" he said. ""We have enough cash on hand to deliver what we need to do.""
As for Rivian's would-be competition, most are wrestling with a variety of issues that could bring their plans to a halt. Here's a sampling of some other EV startups that have been successful in attracting initial funding and that have built working vehicles.
Status: Development work on the B1 and B2 battery-powered off-road vehicles continues while the suburban Detroit company works to raise the $100 million it says it needs to complete engineering and start production.
The company's plan to obtain an industrial building near Dearborn, Mich., and outfit it for low-volume production changed this summer. ""We realized that buying a plant, renovating it extensively, ordering tooling and hiring a brand-new work force would all delay our production for a year or more,"" company founder Robert Bollinger told Automotive News.
Instead, Bollinger inked an agreement with a contract manufacturer to assemble at least the first year's production of about 1,000 total units of the B1 and B2, the boxy electric street-legal off-road vehicles the company has designed and engineered in-house. At a late September press event in a rented building near the company's suburban Detroit engineering center, Bollinger showed two fully engineered prototypes of the four-door versions of the B1 and B2 — vehicles the company says are close to the final production models.
Unlike Rivian's electric pickup, the Bollinger vehicles are about as basic as can be. They are not outfitted with a long menu of electronic features such as in-dash screens, backup cameras or a complicated infotainment system. In fact, the metal, nonpadded dash looks straight out of 1965. Being Class 3 vehicles, the B1 and B2 don't have to conform to many of the safety standards that apply to cars and light trucks. Neither vehicle, for instance, has airbags. Another way Bollinger differs from virtually all of its startup competitors is the size of its staff. As of the end of September, Bollinger Motors employed just 30 engineers, designers and other staffers. ""We are creating a totally different product than what's out there and from what Rivian/Ford are going to do, and we have a different set of needs for money. We are not going for volume,"" Bollinger said.
Next up for the company, Bollinger said, is moving to a bigger location and adding staff as the B1 and B2 move closer to production. Bollinger said they would go on sale in 2021.
Status: Bankrolled by deep-pocketed Chinese investors, the company is moving toward starting production next year of its M-Byte crossover.
At the Frankfurt auto show last month, the Chinese automaker showed its first production-ready vehicle, the M-Byte, a battery-powered crossover with a curved 48-inch screen stretching across the instrument panel. If the company's plans stay on track, Byton will begin delivering the M-Byte to Chinese customers in less than a year and then to customers in North America and Europe in 2021. With investors that include the Nanjing municipal government and FAW Group, one of China's big four automakers, Byton appears to be on solid financial footing.
Its new plant is built, and the production equipment for stamping, welding, painting, assembly and battery packs is being tested now. The M-Byte is powered by an electric motor between the rear wheels, with four-wheel drive optional. Depending on the model, the range between charges is 224 to 270 miles. The European version of the M-Byte is expected to have a base price of about $49,000 based on recent exchange rates.
Status: The company says its FF 91 is nearly production-ready. Faraday is trying to raise $850 million to start making the $150,000 electric car.
Turmoil best describes the state of the company today. A restructuring that got underway in May was funded by $225 million in bridge financing aimed at keeping the company afloat while it paid down debt to suppliers. In early September, a new CEO, BMW veteran Carsten Breitfeld, took over from the founder, Chinese entrepreneur Jia Yueting. In one of his last stints at BMW, Breitfeld — who also happens to be one of the founders of Byton — led the team that developed the BMW i8 plug-in hybrid.
In late September, Faraday took a drubbing on the sale of property it bought in Las Vegas for a plant it hoped to construct there. The company got $16.9 million for the unloaded the 930-acre site that it bought for about $29 million, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. Much of the company's work force remains on unpaid furlough, according to The Verge.
Despite that, Faraday says it is continuing work to ready the FF 91. The swoopy-looking four-door would compete at the upper reaches of the luxury car market. Faraday claims the FF 91's 1,050-hp electric motor can propel the car to 60 mph in less than three seconds. The driving range is claimed to be 378 miles on a charge. Fully loaded, the FF 91's price would be around $200,000. The car runs on the Android operating system and aims to provide a user experience that melds the best traits of Apple, Uber, Google and Tesla. But without financing, Faraday very likely won't meet its goal of delivering its first vehicles a year from now. High-performance luxury EVs from Jaguar, Audi, Mercedes and Porsche will make things tougher for Faraday.
Status: The California manufacturer of gasoline-electric hybrid luxury sedans has been quiet for the past couple of years while rebuilding its management team and redesigning the car that was once the Fisker Karma.
With funding from China's Wanxiang Group Corp., Karma has been able to focus on perfecting the product instead of looking for loans. Previous models used GM powertrains, but those have been replaced in the 2020 Revero GT by BMW units. Leading the re-engineering of the Revero is Bob Kruse, a former GM engineer who was instrumental in the creation of the Chevrolet Volt.
While gearing up to launch the Revero, the company has been active on the auto show circuit and at industry events, displaying three vehicles at the prestigious Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in August. During an industry conference in Traverse City, Mich., that month, Karma let reporters test drive an early production version of the Revero, which starts at $135,000.

Undeterred by patchy charging infrastructure, VW plans for no fewer than 22 million units over the next 10 years and anticipates that by 2030 the electric-car share will surge to at least 40 percent of global deliveries. That lofty projection stands in stark contrast to the realities on German roads today. VW shipped only a handful rekindled battery-powered Golfs last year, and in all of Germany a meager 36,000 electric cars were sold.
“We know the stakes are high, no doubt about that,” said Thomas Ulbrich, a VW lifer and trained metal worker who climbed the corporate ladder to become a board member at the company’s main car brand. “But there is no valid alternative to our strategy.”","Six months ago, Volkswagen Group plunked down a few dozen building containers next to Volkswagen Group sprawling assembly halls in Zwickau, eastern Germany. The graceless space stands apart from the rest of the sleek plant, but The graceless space’s inside that the carmaker is really breaking new ground.
One module houses a walk-in time capsule curated with meticulous attention to detail. There’s a vintage bicycle and antique furniture; old books and black-and-white photos adorn the walls under the glow of light bulbs mounted on old-fashioned fixtures; hidden loudspeakers play the clip-clop of horses pulling carriages.
The not-so-hidden message Volkswagen wants to instill in the minds of Volkswagen 8,000 factory workers being funneled through the installation: change is normal and necessary, and change’s coming here to Zwickau.
The factory represents Ground Zero for one of the most audacious bets in corporate history. It’s here that VW, the world’s biggest carmaker with annual production of more than 10 million vehicles and revenue approaching the gross domestic product of Finland, wants to prove it can morph into an electric-vehicle champion and survive the end of the combustion engine.
Managing the switch is nothing short of open-heart surgery. In Zwickau, most of the factory space is being revamped while production continues. Some 9,000 tons of steel structures are moved, and only about a third of existing machinery can be re-used. With the revamp in full swing, extensive training sessions and seminars kicked off  for everyone from assembly workers to engineers to managers. Electric cars may have four wheels, but Electric cars’re fundamentally different from current vehicles in almost every other respect, from the technical architecture to the way they’re assembled to the materials used.
“It’s like getting changed inside a wardrobe,” said Dirk Coers, the personnel chief of VW’s operations in the region, who is overseeing the transition and VW’s effect on workers. “No one has done something like this before.”
The site is the worldVW’s first car factory switching seamlessly from combustion engines to electric ones, and VW has a lot riding on the experiment, investing $33 billion to develop the world’s biggest battery-vehicle fleet and move toward a lofty goal to become carbon neutral by 2050.
Zwickau is the laboratory for VW’s grand reinvention. The site will become Europe’s largest car plant of The site kind with annual capacity of 330,000 cars, just shy of Volkswagen’s grand reinvention targeted global deliveries this year. The ID3 will start rolling off assembly lines in November, and in 2021 The site will have ceased output of conventional cars altogether. All told, VW will sink 1.2 billion euros ($1.33 billion)  into producing three VW electric vehicles, two for sister brand Audi and another one for Seat in Zwickau.
Volkswagen picked Zwickau because Volkswagen wanted to kick things off with a German site and because a refit is easier at a modern site. Volkswagen’s the opening salvo in a global race in which Volkswagen will convert or add seven other factories in Europe, Asia and the U.S. by the end of 2022, including two in China with a combined annual output of 600,000 vehicles.
The town of 90,000 is no stranger to upheaval. Zwickau is rich in automotive heritage. Zwickau’s here that car pioneer August Horch established Audi more than a century ago, and car pioneer August Horch later became home to the diminutive Trabant car, that boxy emblem of Eastern German mobility whose asthmatic two-stroke engines sputtered down communist roads. Volkswagen picked up the site at the end of 1990, months after Germany was officially reunited, and began building Volkswagen Polo hatchback there.
Volkswagen is placing a big bet on a battery-powered future, and so is Zwickau. Volkswagen is the only major employer in the area, where the population has been shrinking since reunification. In regional elections this month, the far-right AfD party garnered more than a quarter of the votes in Zwickau. Unlike nearby Leipzig, which has attracted substantial investments from companies like BMW and Porsche, most of the money whizzed past Zwickau.
The gloom of the post-communist era’s economic struggle still hangs over the city. Derelict houses with smashed windows and potholes in cobbled streets dot the area around the town center. An air of nostalgia and skepticism fills the wood-paneled pub that dates back 270 years, where the card-playing locals have noticed the growing number of out of towners heading to the VW factory that squats in Saxony’s rolling hills.
“Pretty much everything is changing here at the moment,” said Martin Lehmann, 31, who works in the VW factory’s planning department. “Our jobs, the way Our do things, how decisions are made, just about everything.”
Heiko Roesch oversees the manufacturing of car bodies inside the sprawling hall, home to an armada of 1,625 robots spread across an area equivalent of 11 soccer fields. Every morning at 7:30 a.m., Roesch, 52, gathers engineers, co-workers and suppliers next to the assembly lines to track progress and identify problems.
There’s much to discuss. From an advanced welding technique to a more complex way of fitting the battery into the car to a greater degree of automation aimed at reducing assembly time, employees face challenges everywhere.
At this stage, much of the work that will be taken over by machines is still performed manually as employees come to grips with the new tasks and cars. On a recent visit, three men were untangling cables for the dashboard, a step that will become fully automated to speed things up. The goal is to get to 800 cars a day in three shifts over time from currently about 760.
“At the moment it’s not just about learning how things work, but also about learning why some things do not work,” Roesch said. “If you like dealing with a different issue every day, then this is your place.”
One major challenge is the weight of electric cars, which are heavier mainly because of the battery. The entire assembly line has to be revamped because the ID. 3’s chunky SUV sibling weighs 2.25 tons, more than the existing steel gantry can support.
“For years we’ve been fighting for every ounce to lower vehicle weight, and now this,” said Holger Hollmann, who oversees the assembly operations.
To no small degree, Volkswagen was shocked into this massive retooling exercise by the diesel-cheating scandal that erupted four years ago this month, throwing the carmaker into an existential crisis and forcing the carmaker to radically rethink the carmaker future. Like most incumbent carmakers, VW had never really embraced electric cars. In Zwickau the carmaker assembled a small number of electric Golfs before culling the project in 1996. the carmaker would take the shock waves of the diesel scandal to prod Volkswagen into action. With Volkswagen balance sheet intact despite unprecedented fines, VW is now putting VW vast engineering and financial muscle to work.
“VW’s recent earnings and cash flow performance has been impressive,” Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said. “However, being the largest player in Europe and taking the greatest bet on battery-electric vehicles also bears significant risks that shouldn’t be ignored.”
There’s reason for skepticism. While earning money with upscale electric cars that can command higher prices is already proving difficult (just ask Elon Musk), no one has even come close to making affordable ones without burning vast amounts of cash. The ID. 3, which will be unveiled next week in Frankfurt, starts at 29,900 euros, in line with the diesel version of the Golf.

When asked what their biggest complaint was in financing their last vehicle, 59.2% said the process took a long time from start to finish, and another 21.4% said there were too many steps involved.

Domestic automakers are reeling from a combination of bad luck and factors partly of their own making.
Chinese brands are struggling especially because their target customers have been hit harder than those of global brands by the slowing economy.
China’s economic growth slowed to 6.2 percent in the second quarter, down from 6.6 percent for all of 2018.
Domestic brands mainly produce compact and subcompact sedans and crossovers for low-income consumers who typically live in rural and inland China.
And they market the vehicles at prices ranging from 50,000 yuan ($7,100) to 100,000 yuan, which are affordable options.
But facing dim economic prospects, low-income consumers are more likely than affluent households to cut discretionary spending on big-ticket items such as cars.
That’s the harsh reality Geely has run into.
Geely has made substantial progress in expanding its product portfolio. This year it launched sales of three new products – the brand’s first multipurpose vehicle, a compact crossover that shares a platform with the Volvo XC40 and a compact car under the newly created electric vehicle brand, Geometry.
But none of the new models has generated meaningful volume. Geely sales fell 24 percent to 91,375 in July.
Most domestic Chinese carmakers, spurred by generous government subsidies, have invested heavily to launch electrified vehicles in the past few years.
It has turned out to be an ill-conceived strategy.
On June 25, Beijing finished slashing subsidies by more than 50 percent for EVs and plug-in hybrids.
The move instantly chilled demand for those vehicles.
In July, sales of EVs and plug-in hybrids at BYD Co., China’s largest electrified vehicle maker, dropped for the first time this year, declining 12 percent from a year earlier.
Another major domestic EV maker, Jianghuai Automobile Co., had its EV sales plunge 66 percent last month.
The sobering truth is that consumers have little interest in electrified vehicles without sufficient government subsidies.
In the first half, aggregate light-vehicle sales at Chinese brands tumbled 22 percent to below 4 million. As a result, their domestic market share dipped 3.9 percentage points from the year-earlier period to below 40 percent.
But that is not the end of their woes.
Economic growth will remain subdued, dampening new-vehicle demand, as long as China’s trade dispute with the United States plays out.
And with Beijing set to phase out remaining subsidies for EVs and plug-in hybrids by year end, Chinese brands will find it even tougher to navigate at home.","SHANGHAI -- Chinese brands continue to lose market share at home, and the biggest domestic carmaker -- Geely Automobile Holdings -- isn't immune, with sales tumbling more than 20 percent for the fourth straight month in July.

At the time Tesla inked the deal with MUSA, the EV maker was ramping up production on its newest vehicle, the Model 3, and burning through cash. Tesla needed partners to help originate leases so it could preserve capital for other operations, a source told Automotive News last year.
But what appeared to be a dream deal for MUSA soured in October when MUSA told dealer customers it could no longer finance new deals because of the Tesla partnership. MUSA's leasing volume increased sixfold from August to September, the company wrote in an email to dealer customers. According to MUSA, Tesla sent $50 million in leasing contracts to MUSA over one weekend alone.
MUSA's abrupt halt in business left dealer partners without funding and some customers without the vehicles they had leased.
MUSA, which was founded in 2016, originated $157.5 million in auto loans and leases in 2018 — its entire lending capacity — for 450 dealer partners, according to a January statement from PowerBand about its negotiations to buy the MUSA stake. Of that 2018 origination total, more than half came from Tesla leases.
The Tesla business didn't come cheap. According to the January statement from PowerBand, the average vehicle lease value for a Tesla was $98,000 — more than double the average lease value of its core portfolio. MUSA originated $24.5 million in leases in 2017.
MUSA's tapped-out $157.5 million financing facility was subsequently sold to private equity firm Crestline Investors Inc. in May, MUSA said. Alongside Goldman Sachs, Crestline had contributed $50 million to MUSA's first credit line, which was capped at $125 million.
""Crestline, while a good partner to me, they were limited in their ability to grow it beyond the demand that we had,"" MUSA's Morgan said. ""We outperformed our facility's capabilities.""
Tesla declined last week to comment on its relationship with MUSA and would not confirm an ongoing relationship with the finance company.
Morgan told Automotive News that the company had enough capital to continue paying workers while it was not originating new business.
MUSA continued receiving payments and servicing income from existing leases. The company declined to say how many employees it has or whether any jobs were cut in the aftermath of the halt in originations.
Morgan said all dealers were eventually funded.
""We had a couple that weren't happy because [the dealers] were smaller,"" Morgan said. ""I didn't realize I did put a strain on a couple that I've called, and I've apologized for.""
The controversy around how the Tesla business unfolded didn't dissuade PowerBand from the deal.
PowerBand CEO Kelly Jennings told Automotive News that MUSA's decision-making software was the main driver of the acquisition.
""Our interest in MUSA was the technology, and with our partnerships here in the U.S. and contacts, we believe that we can help take MUSA to the next level,"" Jennings said.
The sale of MUSA's full credit facility to Crestline makes for a cleaner transaction for PowerBand, according to Michael Buckingham, senior director of J.D.

And regardless of whether MUSA continues a relationship with Tesla, MUSA's software platform is an attractive asset, Buckingham said.

Tesla Inc. declined last week to comment on Tesla Inc. relationship with MUSA and would not confirm an ongoing relationship with Tesla Inc..
"" MUSA's Morgan told Automotive News that Tesla Inc. had enough capital to continue paying workers while Tesla Inc. was not originating new business.
MUSA continued receiving payments and servicing income from existing leases. Tesla Inc. declined to say how many employees Tesla Inc. has or whether any jobs were cut in the aftermath of the halt in originations.
"" MUSA's Morgan said all dealers were eventually funded.
""Tesla Inc. had a couple that weren't happy because [the dealers] were smaller,"" "" MUSA's Morgan said. ""I didn't realize I did put a strain on a couple that I've called, and I've apologized for.""
The controversy around how the Tesla Inc. business unfolded didn't dissuade PowerBand from the deal.
PowerBand CEO Kelly Jennings told Automotive News that MUSA's decision-making software was the main driver of the acquisition.
""Our interest in MUSA was the technology, and with Our partnerships here in the U.S. and contacts, Our believe that Our can help take MUSA to the next level,"" PowerBand CEO Kelly Jennings said.
The sale of MUSA's full credit facility to Crestline makes for a cleaner transaction for PowerBand, according to Michael Buckingham, senior director of J.D. Power's automotive finance practice in Costa Mesa, Calif. Given how long operations were halted at the lender, Calif.'s possible Crestline bought MUSA's full credit facility to Crestline at a discount.
And regardless of whether MUSA continues a relationship with Tesla, MUSA's software platform is an attractive asset, Buckingham said.
""Clearly, they feel they've got a very strong technology platform that enables fast decisioning,Buckingham Buckingham said. ""There's value to a very robust proprietary origination engine."""

CEO Hiroto Saikawa will slash some 12,500 jobs worldwide as part of new plan to revive the company after reporting a 99 percent plunge in operating profit in the latest quarter on falling sales in every major market except China.
Saikawa’s emergency overhaul comes as he tries to speed up a recovery plan running through the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. He said earnings would gradually start to recover in the second half of this fiscal year, after a brutal first quarter he said was worse than expected.
Operating profit was nearly wiped out, tumbling to 1.6 billion yen ($14.8 million) in fiscal first quarter ended June 30, the company announced Thursday in its quarterly results. Operating profit margin shriveled to a 0.1 percent, compared with 4.0 percent a year earlier.
Net income dropped 95 percent to 6.4 billion ($59.3 million) in the April-June period.
Nissan’s revenue slid 13 percent to 2.37 trillion yen ($21.97 billion) in the three months, as global retail volume declined 6.0 percent to 1.23 million vehicles.
“The results were really more negative than we expected,” Saikawa said in a briefing here at Nissan’s global headquarters. “We thought the situation would be challenging. But the actual retail performance was slightly under what we expected. We have to admit that.”
The earnings collapse adds to the sense of crisis enveloping Saikawa, who is simultaneously trying to reform corporate governance at Nissan and smooth relations with French partner Renault. Nissan’s house was thrown into disarray by last year’s arrest of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn for alleged financial misconduct during his time at the helm of the Japanese carmaker.
Saikawa, now presiding over a post-Ghosn era in which Nissan’s U.S. profit engine imploded, wants to rebuild U.S. sales to 1.4 million vehicles in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023.
In May, he outlined plans to restore parent company operating profit margin to 6 percent in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. It finished last year at a meager 2.7 percent.
At this week’s earning’s announcement, Saikawa fleshed out the blueprint with more details.
Job cuts
Chief among the measures is a plan to cut some 12,500 jobs worldwide by March 31, 2023.
The losses encompass 4,800 job cuts Saikawa already announced in May and amount to about 9 percent of Nissan’s global workforce of roughly 140,000 people.
Saikawa said Thursday that some 6,400 cuts are already underway at eight locations worldwide through the end of the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2020. They are:
Another 6,100 cuts are being planned through the spring of 2023, Saikawa said.
Nissan declined to give details on those reductions but said they will happen at six locations. 
Saikawa said the cutbacks will focus on plants that are working below capacity, plants that make small cars and factories making Datsun products. Most of those will be factory jobs.
“Loss-making overseas factories would be the main targets,” Saikawa said.
The goal is to cut Nissan’s global production capacity to 6.6 million vehicles a year, from 7.2 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, Saikawa said.
Doing so will boost the global utilization rate to 86 percent from 69 percent, he forecast.
Saikawa said the reforms should help the parent company's operating profit to more than double to 870 billion yen ($8.07 billion) in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023.
Improvements in U.S. operations will account for 40 percent of the 480 billion-yen ($4.45 billion) gain. 
Global sales by then should hit 6 million vehicles, from 5.5 million last year.
U.S. retail challenge
Saikawa is trying to pivot Nissan away from profit-draining fleet sales and incentives in the U.S. in an attempt to shore up brand value and margins. In the first quarter, Nissan was able to trim U.S. incentive outlays by 3.0 billion yen ($27.8 million).
“Not to push wholesale but to increase retail, that was the starting point of the plan,” Saikawa said. “In the first quarter, we were planting the seeds. We tried to reorganize the car flow.”
As a result, retail sales outpaced wholesale deliveries and U.S. inventories shrank.
“Normalization of sales is making progress,” Saikawa.
Nissan Group dealers in the U.S. had a 56-day supply of vehicles as of July 1, unchanged from June 1 but lower than the industry average of 69 days, according to the Automotive News Data Center.
Nissan’s backlog was 51 days in January.
Worldwide wholesale shipments dropped 10 percent in the first quarter.
Saikawa said he wants to boost profitability in the U.S. by raising the ratio of retail sales. His goal is to boost pure retail sales by 100,000 units during the current revival plan.
“This is one of the key milestones we should be watching,” he said.

LG Chem, one of the leading EV battery makers in the world that counts General Motors and Volkswagen Group among its customers, is weighing investing about $1.7 billion in the plant that could begin production in 2022, one of the people said. Kentucky and Tennessee are among the candidates for the plant's site, the person said.
A decision on the plant's site is expected to be made by the end of this month, another person said.
Automakers are pushing ahead with billions of dollars in investments in electric vehicles to meet global regulatory requirements. A new plant by LG Chem would come as South Korean companies have stepped up U.S. investments, moves that have been praised by President Donald Trump.
LG Chem's new factory would primarily supply Volvo, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, and potentially Hyundai Motor Co., GM and Volkswagen, one of the people said.
LG Chem, the most valuable company of the LG conglomerate, did not provide a comment when contacted by Reuters. The sources declined to be named as the plan is confidential.
A second U.S. plant would come amid a growing rivalry between LG Chem and crosstown rival SK Innovation, which recently broke ground on its $1 billion U.S. EV battery plant to primarily supply Volkswagen.
Earlier this year, LG Chem sued SK Innovation in the United States for alleged theft of trade secrets by hiring its former employees.
“We are currently pursuing another production base,” LG Chem's new CEO Shin Hak Cheol told reporters this week, without elaborating on the country.
Electric vehicle sales are projected to reach 1.28 million vehicles by 2026 in the U.S. alone, compared with less than 200,000 in 2018, according to market researcher IHS Markit.
Trump and Moon
Trump praised U.S. investments by SK, Lotte Group and other South Korean conglomerates and raised hopes that Korean companies will continue to expand in the United States.
""Thank you very much. Congratulations. It’s a great job,"" he said during his meeting with South Korean business leaders in Seoul on June 30. The participants included group holding company LG Corp.'s Vice Chairman Kwon Young Soo.
LG Chem, the battery supplier for GM's Bolt, currently operates an EV battery plant in Michigan. LG Chem also has production bases in South Korea, China and Poland.
It drew attention during the groundbreaking of its first U.S. production facility in 2010, when former President Barack Obama traveled to Michigan for the event.
LG Chem is also being wooed by the government of South Korean President Moon Jae-in to build a new domestic factory to create jobs -- one of Moon's top priorities.
CEO Shin said LG Chem is in talks to build a production facility for cathode materials used in EV batteries in the southeastern city of Gumi in South Korea, but details have not been finalized.","SEOUL/DETROIT -- South Korean electric vehicle battery maker LG Chem is considering building a second U.S. factory, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters, accelerating a race to add capacity to meet growing global demand for green vehicles.
LG Chem, one of the leading EV battery makers in the world that counts General Motors and Volkswagen Group among Volkswagen Group customers, is weighing investing about $1.7 billion in the plant that could begin production in 2022, one of the people said. Kentucky and Tennessee are among the candidates for the plant's site, the person said.
A decision on the plant's site is expected to be made by the end of this month, another person said.
Automakers are pushing ahead with billions of dollars in investments in electric vehicles to meet global regulatory requirements. A new plant by LG Chem would come as South Korean companies have stepped up U.S. investments, moves that have been praised by President Donald Trump.
LG Chem new factory would primarily supply Volvo, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, and potentially Hyundai Motor Co., GM and Volkswagen, one of the people said.
LG Chem, the most valuable company of the LG conglomerate, did not provide a comment when contacted by Reuters. The sources declined to be named as the plan is confidential.
A second U.S. plant would come amid a growing rivalry between LG Chem and crosstown rival SK Innovation, which recently broke ground on LG Chem $1 billion U.S. EV battery plant to primarily supply Volkswagen.
Earlier this year, LG Chem sued SK Innovation in the United States for alleged theft of trade secrets by hiring LG Chem former employees.

Depending on the source of them wealth, loans can lead a banker into a client’s business finances, which may be commingled with personal assets, Beardsley said.
Why do the ultra-wealthy even need to take out loans? Some, like Musk, are asset-rich but relatively cash-poor. Lending activity picks up as tax time approaches, with clients either fully invested or not as liquid as clients need to be to make a tax payment, UBS’s Blum said.
“We try to educate clients that what you probably don’t want to do is sell stocks or bonds and create yet another tax liability by selling so you can pay your taxes this year,” UBS’s Blum said.
Ultra-wealthy investors may also find mortgage interest a relatively small price to pay for liquidity. “With rates still historically low, it’s still a very attractive alternative,” UBS’s Blum said. “Clients would just rather not tie up all the liquidity in a purchase of a very expensive property.”
Lending to the wealthy extends beyond mortgages. The most bread-and-butter type of asset-based borrowing is securities-based lending on a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. Other assets that can be borrowed against include art, yachts, pre-IPO shares and hedge-fund stakes. Hedge funds and the general partners in private-equity funds may take out so-called partner loans in order to invest in a new fund without tapping Hedge funds and the general partners in private-equity funds own liquidity, said Deloitte’s Vincent.
Then there are the truly rarefied loans. Deloitte’s Vincent recalls one situation with a Middle Eastern client from the days when Deloitte’s Vincent was a private banker. a Middle Eastern client wanted to buy a Boeing 747 “and redo the inside so a Middle Eastern client family could fly from the Middle East to London to Paris to do his family shopping on the weekend,Deloitte’s Vincent Deloitte’s Vincent said."

Mitsubishi's decision is yet another loss for Southern California, referred to in 2000 as ""Motown West"" for the concentration of automotive brands that based the concentration of automotive brands that based their U.S. operations there U.S. operations there. Since then, the brands under Ford's former Premier Automotive Group — Lincoln, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo — moved back east, Suzuki stopped selling cars in U.S. and Toyota moved to a huge campus in Plano, Texas.
In addition, Nissan moved Nissan North American headquarters from Los Angeles to Nashville in 2006, leaving behind about 60 percent of Nissan 1,300 staffers and executives at the time. ""
Mitsubishi said one reason ""
Mitsubishi chose Franklin was the area's high-tech community, along with cost savings, a business-friendly work environment and proximity to Nissan.
Left in California are Honda, Mazda, Hyundai and Kia. However, fledgling Chinese brands such as GAC, Karma and Zotye have set up shop in the region.
""
Mitsubishi's U.S. revival is accelerating, with sales gains for the last six years straight, topping 100,000 vehicles in both 2017 and 2018. Sales through the first five months of this year are up 4.6 percent compared with the same period last year."

Falling membership
At its peak in 1979, the UAW represented 1.5 million workers. Last year, after nine years of gains, membership dropped again below 400,000.
The union's gains in recent years had come mostly from unionizing casino workers, graduate students and nurses instead of automotive workers.
Brandi Ginger, 43, who works in quality control at the VW plant, dislikes that history of decline.

Maury Nicely, a Chattanooga attorney who oversees Southern Momentum, an anti-UAW group, said the union would scare away other potential investors and ""render us less competitive.""
A victory in Chattanooga would give the UAW a psychological boost, but the major manufacturing operations of Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. lie further south in states like Alabama and Mississippi that lack Tennessee's history of partial unionization.

Hendrick Automotive Group, recognizing the shift toward digital retailing, decided five years ago to look at a fully electronic, digital deal jacket. ""What we wanted to do was completely digitize our F&I process in the dealership,"" said Robert Taylor, the group's vice president of information technology.
About three years ago, Hendrick decided to install the Reynolds and Reynolds docuPad, a large, electronic, touch-screen device that allows deals to be constructed on a digital screen. It automatically verifies that documents are signed, and the data it collects can provide audits and usage reports. As of last summer, all 96 Hendrick stores had it.

""So on the digital side, you know, there's really not that opportunity for them to do those types of actions.""
John Tabar, who leads training at F&I company United Development Systems Inc., said interest in digitizing the F&I process has grown, especially in the past two years. Dealers are trying to make the F&I experience as seamless and easy as possible, he said.

It's simply in response to the way people are buying things now. ""We need to start offering products in F&I like we do everything else [consumers] buy, and talk about it that way,"" Tabar said. ""I think that's what's driving it.""
Of course, going digital can pose problems. Sometimes different digital worlds are not well integrated, said Ritch Wheeler, vice president of training at F&I product and training company American Financial & Automotive Services Inc. Depending on which provider the dealership subscribes to with its dealership management system or its customer relationship management program, ""a lot of times the choices are made to go with the shiniest new toy, but it sometimes doesn't play well with others,"" he said, echoing a gripe among dealers that some DMS and CRMs are difficult to integrate with outside software.
More of a concern, however, is whether digital tools could be prone to mistakes that could leave dealers vulnerable to compliance problems. Wheeler said he met with an F&I manager who was using a digital desking tool. The store had to update its printed buyers' guides on vehicle windows, but the dealership had failed to do so on the digital copies. Wheeler had caught it before the dealership ran into any trouble and helped fix it.
Improperly displayed buyers' guides — which say whether a vehicle is being sold as-is or with a warranty, and advise shoppers accordingly — was one of the three most commonly identified compliance problems during audits last year of clients of KPA, a risk-management software company.
The other top problems were customers' sensitive information being left out in the open and Monroney stickers missing or being improperly displayed.
In the case of the buyers' guides, dealers may have to make sure that in-vehicle and digital copies are updated as auto retailing transitions forward. But Trevor Stage, senior manager of product innovation at KPA, said he is not concerned that digital F&I tools could put compliance at risk.
Quite the opposite, he said, because digital tools can enable dealers to easily track compliance and to hold employees accountable. ""What the compliance management system offers dealerships is not only to point out where the dealer may be putting itself at risk, but also highlight the peak performers,"" he said.
The important thing is for dealers to make sure they have the proper training in place, and the right people using the relatively novel digital F&I tools, experts said.
""There's an amount of compliance built in, for sure,"" said Tabar of United Development Systems. ""But I think that sometimes we get into a little bit of trouble when we think that the software that we're utilizing is all we need.""
If someone is going to be dishonest, there's not a lot of technology available that can get around that. Overall, training is key for everyone, especially on newer tools.
If dealers expect a robust tool alone will lead to success, they're wrong, said Taylor of Hendrick Automotive. People still drive the process.
""We're not looking at hiring lesser individuals or lower-cost individuals because we've made this investment in this particular technology,"" he added. ""It still comes down to the people.""","As automotive retailing becomes more digital, so does the financing process surrounding automotive retailing. Digital tools in the finance and insurance office have made dealers more efficient and more compliant. But Digital tools in the finance and insurance office're still only as good the people using Digital tools in the finance and insurance office, F&I experts say.
Hendrick Automotive Group, recognizing the shift toward digital retailing, decided five years ago to look at a fully electronic, digital deal jacket. ""What Hendrick Automotive Group wanted to do was completely digitize Hendrick Automotive Group F&I process in the dealership,"" said Taylor.
About three years ago, Hendrick decided to install the Reynolds and Reynolds docuPad, a large, electronic, touch-screen device that allows deals to be constructed on a digital screen. the Reynolds and Reynolds docuPad, a large, electronic, touch-screen device that allows deals to be constructed on a digital screen automatically verifies that documents are signed, and the data the Reynolds and Reynolds docuPad, a large, electronic, touch-screen device that allows deals to be constructed on a digital screen collects can provide audits and usage reports. As of last summer, all 96 Hendrick stores had the Reynolds and Reynolds docuPad, a large, electronic, touch-screen device that allows deals to be constructed on a digital screen.
Neither Hendrick Automotive Group's customers nor Hendrick Automotive Group employees want to go back to sorting through paperwork, Taylor said. Digitizing the F&I process has eliminated thousands of documents and made the transaction exponentially more efficient. ""Most people nowadays have an expectation that Most people're going to walk into a modern F&I office and walk away with something electronic,Taylor Taylor said.
The change has also improved Hendrick Automotive Group's compliance, Taylor said. ""In the past, when you were dealing with individual paper forms, and sort of an analog world, it's just human nature to forget a form, or miss a signature, or something to that effect,"" Taylor said. ""So on the digital side, you know, there's really not that opportunity for them to do those types of actions.""
John Tabar, who leads training at F&I company United Development Systems Inc., said interest in digitizing the F&I process has grown, especially in the past two years. Dealers are trying to make the F&I experience as seamless and easy as possible, John Tabar, who leads training at F&I company United Development Systems Inc. said.

It's simply in response to the way people are buying things now. ""We need to start offering products in F&I like We do everything else [consumers] buy, and talk about it that way,"" Tabar said. ""I think that's what's driving it.""
Of course, going digital can pose problems. Sometimes different digital worlds are not well integrated, said Ritch Wheeler, vice president of training at F&I product and training company American Financial & Automotive Services Inc. Depending on which provider the dealership subscribes to with Automotive Services Inc. dealership management system or Automotive Services Inc. customer relationship management program, ""a lot of times the choices are made to go with the shiniest new toy, but the shiniest new toy sometimes doesn't play well with others,"" John Tabar, who leads training at F&I company United Development Systems Inc. said, echoing a gripe among dealers that some DMS and CRMs are difficult to integrate with outside software.
More of a concern, however, is whether digital tools could be prone to mistakes that could leave dealers vulnerable to compliance problems. Wheeler said Wheeler met with an F&I manager who was using a digital desking tool. The store had to update The store printed buyers' guides on vehicle windows, but the dealership had failed to do so on the digital copies. Wheeler had caught the digital copies before the dealership ran into any trouble and helped fix the digital copies.

Jolted by GM closure
Concerns about Brampton heightened after General Motors said it would shutter its Oshawa Assembly Plant at the end of the year, citing falling demand for passenger cars among its reasons. The plant produces the Chevrolet Imp and Cadillac XTS sedans.
GM has since said it will keep the plant open to produce aftermarket parts. It will also turn part of the property into a test track for autonomous vehicles.
“After GM Oshawa, we saw Chrysler Brampton as being the most vulnerable plant in Canada,” Holmes said. “The market has gone really soft for cars, especially for sedans.”
For now, the Brampton plant’s future seems assured even after FCA announced in March that it would idle both Brampton and Windsor assembly plants for two weeks in April and cut its third shift in Windsor in September to better align production with demand. The Windsor plant builds the Chrysler Pacifica and Dodge Grand Caravan minivans.
“There’s a big difference between what FCA announced in Windsor and what GM announced in Oshawa,” Volpe said.
“Currently, demand for the production Brampton is quite strong,” he said.
And while sale of the Pacifica and Grand Caravan minivans are struggling, FCA is not going to give up its leadership position in the segment, said Joe McCabe, CEO of U.S.-based forecasting and consulting firm AutoForecast Solutions.
While FCA Canada won’t comment on future product, McCabe said the automaker is planning to introduce an all-wheel-drive version of the Pacifica as well as an entry-level replacement for the Grand Caravan, which is currently built on a separate and older platform. The new vehicle, said McCabe, will be assembled on the Pacifica platform.

GM has since said GM will keep its Oshawa Assembly Plant open to produce aftermarket parts. GM will also turn part of the property into a test track for autonomous vehicles.
“After GM Oshawa, we saw Brampton Brampton as being the most vulnerable plant in Canada,” Holmes said. “The market has gone really soft for cars, especially for sedans.”
For now, the Brampton plant’s future seems assured even after FCA announced in March that FCA would idle both Brampton and Windsor assembly plants for two weeks in April and cut FCA third shift in Windsor in September to better align production with demand. its Oshawa Assembly Plant Windsor builds the Chrysler Pacifica and Dodge Grand Caravan minivans.
“There’s a big difference between what FCA announced in Windsor and what GM announced in GM Oshawa,” Volpe said.
“Currently, demand for Brampton Brampton is quite strong,” Volpe said.
And while sale of Chrysler Pacifica and Dodge Grand Caravan Grand Caravan minivans are struggling, FCA is not going to give up FCA leadership position in the segment, said McCabe.
While FCA Canada won’t comment on future product, McCabe said the automaker is planning to introduce an all-wheel-drive version of Pacifica as well as an entry-level replacement for the Grand Caravan, which is currently built on a separate and older platform. The new vehicle, said McCabe, will be assembled on the Pacifica platform.
“The fact that they’re investing in all-wheel drive means they’re actually trying to take it another step up they’re not trying to pull away from they minivan strategy. If you consolidate that all on the Pacifica platform ... there’s potential for improving your manufacturing operations.”"

All-wheel or four-wheel drive is standard on most SUVs and trucks, helping to boost its availability to a record 63.4 percent of new vehicles sold last year, up from 56.4 percent a decade ago, according to data from Edmunds. Automakers are betting that by passing these powertrain variants on to passenger cars, they’ll be able to prop up their sagging sales.

Nissan Motor Co. began offering all-wheel drive on its latest Altima sedan in the U.S. in November. Since then, the company says more than 20 percent of buyers in the U.S. have opted for the $1,350 package, and close to half of all Altima sales in wintry markets such as the Northeast have all-wheel drive.
One of those buyers is Josh Bothell, a 34-year-old retail store supervisor, who recently purchased an Altima from a Nissan dealership in Old Saybrook, Conn. Bothell had previously owned a 2005 model, then traded that in for a 2013 Subaru Impreza. He said he wouldn’t have gone back to the Altima without the all-wheel drive option.

Seventy-three proposals were received by the DOT, and the list of applicants includes the usual batch of big cities, such as Boston and Los Angeles, along with state, regional and local transportation departments, and more than a dozen universities.

Those plans include applying for DOT grants that would pay to run three EZ10 shuttles from manufacturer EasyMile for as long as 18 hours per day. Three fixed routes would connect the three colleges with downtown, and help connect workers with major employers in the area.
""What was interesting was the business leaders in the room said, 'We need you to do this to get people to work,' "" Miller said. ""Right now, they're all doing creative things to reach deeper into the work force.""
One wrinkle: Some of the routes, as currently planned, would require crossing intersections with traffic lights. Miller says those lights would need to be outfitted with certain technology to integrate with EasyMile's shuttles, and Adrian has requested $100,000 as part of its grant proposal to pay for those upgrades.
The grant proposal put forth by the Indian Nations Council is notable because it does not rely on fixed-route operations. Instead, the council has partnered with Optimus Ride and designed a service that could provide door-to-door service for residents from vehicles that are hailed on demand, either via an app or phone call.
The problem isn't so much about transportation as it is about food.
""We're trying to provide people with a real transportation solution to get to a grocery store,"" said Adriane Jaynes, alternative fuels planner with the council, which has proposed providing the Optimus Ride shuttle in a 9-square-mile area identified as a food desert.
It can take 50 to 60 minutes for residents to get to a grocery store via current public transportation options, she said. Frozen foods might thaw or melt by the time shoppers arrive home.
At the same time, residents often shop for an entire month's worth of provisions in a single trip, so they're not inclined to buy fresh groceries either. ""You have to have more transportation options to encourage them to buy fresh,"" Jaynes said.
What's motivating many of those who submitted grants is the feeling that if these towns can capitalize on automated-driving technology, they can prove AV technology's viability for thousands of smaller and rural communities.
""For us, it's partially about we don't want to be left behind as Silicon Valley prepares for the future,"" said Viplav Putta, director of the council's transportation division. ""If they can make it run safely here, I'm sure they can replicate it everywhere else.""","A speck on the map, Hillsboro, population 1,609, is a farming community that sits along Interstate 29 in the far eastern fringes of North Dakota. It is, at once, in the middle of nowhere and at the nexus of forces reshaping transportation.
Farmers are eyeing the use of automated tractors to plow fields. A nearby beet-processing facility faces a chronic shortage of truck drivers available to haul A nearby beet-processing facility products. Unmanned aerial systems are tested at the town's airport, where engineers pioneer systems that allow drones to fly beyond line of sight.
Soon, a self-driving shuttle bus may trundle along the town's streets. Hillsboro has applied for funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation, which will award as much as $60 million in grants this spring to communities and organizations seeking to demonstrate automated-driving systems.
Seventy-three proposals were received by the DOT, and the list of applicants includes the usual batch of big cities, such as Boston and Los Angeles, along with state, regional and local transportation departments, and more than a dozen universities.
But the list of applicants also includes small towns and rural communities such as Adrian, Mich., and Hillsboro, as well as the Indian Nations Council of Governments, a voluntary association of local and tribal governments that conducts planning across a five-county region around Tulsa, Okla.
Far from Silicon Valley and other urban hotspots, the applications from smaller towns and organizations shows how the potential of automated-driving machines has seeped into the ambitions of communities across the country.
Like the Smart City Challenge before the Smart City Challenge, the Automated Driving System Demonstration Grants program provides a catalyst for imagining a transportation future unlocked by autonomy. This time around, multiple awards will likely be made, rather than a single one, though DOT officials haven't set a firm number that will be doled out later this spring.
For many smaller communities and entities, a little funding may go a long way. Here's a look at some of their plans.
One of the earliest challenges for Levi Reese, vice president of the commission that runs the city, was keeping the conversation going with representatives of self-driving shuttle companies.
""Most of the companies we talked to would ask we, 'How many buses do you want, 20?' "" Reese said. ""we're like, 'No, just one.' ""
French shuttle maker Navya, which has the only assembly plant dedicated solely to automated vehicles in North America, finally answered the city's call for an automated-vehicle partner for the grant proposal. Together, they have proposed a three-phase plan that starts with a fixed route around downtown that would help residents get to doctor's appointments, grocery stores and schools.
Later, they would add a ride-sharing component that would expand into more far-flung locations in the area and eventually help ferry residents to jobs at the beet-processing plant outside town and one day connect they with Grand Forks and Fargo.
""It's tying all these things together,"" said Terry Sando, the city commission's president. ""Maybe one works, or maybe two do. We don't know. That's part of the research. ... But We know that when you live out on the farm or in the country and you don't drive anymore, your options are very limited.""

Shape of alliance
The jockeying last year came as uncertainty hung over the partnership Ghosn had dominated for two decades. The 65-year old auto titan, who remains jailed in Japan awaiting trial, was chairman of Nissan at the time and had just signed a new deal to remain chairman and CEO at Renault. In doing so, he had pledged to honor French demands that he make the three-way alliance that includes Mitsubishi Motors Corp. “irreversible,” while cautioning that Japan would resist a tighter structure if France remained a shareholder.
The rear-guard action at Nissan also lays bare the depth of suspicion between the companies and countries over the alliance -- among the top producers of cars globally -- before Ghosn was arrested in November on allegations of financial misconduct. He has denied the charges and blamed a “plot” against him by Nissan executives who are playing “dirty games.”
Carole Ghosn, the wife of the former auto titan, called on U.S. President Donald Trump to speak about his detention to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe when they meet in Washington next week. “Please, President Trump, please ask Abe to resolve this injustice,” she wrote in an opinion piece in the Washington Post.
While the content of the documents, first reported by French newspaper Journal du Dimanche, do not prove Ghosn’s allegations, they do show a Nissan leadership preoccupied with preventing what they saw as a French power grab.
Nissan officials, who had been coordinating with the Japanese economy ministry, were also concerned the demands in its memo could harm the discussions that Ghosn was carefully trying to inch toward a solution.

A special report in this issue of Fixed Ops Journal takes a fresh look at service and parts pay plans. We examine how they are, or aren't, doing what dealers intend them to do.
More than a century ago, Ford Motor Co. conducted time-and-motion studies to determine how long various car-repair and maintenance jobs should take. Ford urged its dealers to pay their mechanics on that basis, however long it actually took them to complete the jobs, rather than with a straight salary.
Thus the flat rate system came to service departments in a big way. Under pressure from mechanics who threatened to quit because they considered the system unfair, Ford temporarily backed away from flat rate during the Great Depression.
Today, nearly three-fourths of dealerships still use flat rate as the foundation of their technician pay plans, according to a survey by Carlisle & Co. Dealers and service directors continue to insist that flat rate promotes efficiency and productivity in their shops, keeping customers satisfied and coming back.

Dealers and fixed ops leaders assert that it's not only proper but necessary to base a substantial amount of advisers' pay on the volume of additional services and products Dealers and fixed ops leaders sell Dealers and fixed ops leaders customers. But many advisers — and ex-advisers — tell of feeling coerced by their bosses into browbeating customers to buy work their neither need nor want, to meet this month's sales goals.
That, their say, depresses their customer satisfaction scores, which also can help determine their compensation.
The balancing act: How do you provide appropriate incentives for advisers to sell what your customers and advisers cars truly need now, without crossing an ethical line into high-pressure sales tactics? Our story offers some ideas for piercing that Gordian knot.
The primary job of the parts counter would seem straightforward: to ensure that technicians have the parts technicians need in technicians bays to get technicians work done promptly.
But Greg Dryden, vice president of client optimization at Dealer-FX, calls parts departments at many dealerships ""the No. 1 cause of lost tech productivity."" He proposes tying as much as 30 percent of parts-counter workers' pay to hours turned in the shop.
As dealerships rely on fixed operations for an increasing share of dealerships profits, a lot of stores also are pursuing lucrative sidelines in outside sales of parts, online, by mail and over the counter, both wholesale and retail. How best to incentivize a parts-counter worker to achieve both goals?
Go here for ideas from industry experts and dealers who have used dealers pay plans to enhance the efficiency and profitability of dealers parts desks. We hope We special report will provide some starting points for innovation in all aspects of your fixed ops pay packages."

The pledge by one of the world's biggest automakers to share its closely guarded patents, the second time it has opened up a technology, is aimed at driving industry uptake of hybrids and fending off the challenge of all-battery electric vehicles.
Toyota said it would grant licenses on nearly 24,000 patents on technologies used in its Prius, the world's first mass-produced ""green"" car, and offer to supply competitors with components including motors, power converters and batteries used in its lower-emissions vehicles.
""We want to look beyond producing finished vehicles,"" Toyota Executive Vice President Shigeki Terashi told reporters.
""We want to contribute to an increase in take up (of electric cars) by offering not just our technology but our existing parts and systems to other vehicle makers.""
The Nikkei Asian Review first reported Toyota's plans to give royalty-free access to hybrid-vehicle patents.
Terashi said that the access excluded patents on its lithium-ion battery technology.
Key technology
Toyota's move to unlock its patents underlines its belief that hybrids are an effective alternative to all-battery EVs, given a fuel efficiency roughly double that of gasoline cars, lower cost and that they do not need charging infrastructure.
Toyota vehicles account for more than 80 percent of the global hybrid vehicle market.
""Toyota has realized that they made a mistake by protecting their hybrid technology for years. This prevented diffusion"" said Janet Lewis, head of Asia transportation research at Macquarie Securities.
""Toyota on its own can't get key technology accepted, but if other companies use it, that offers the best chance of expansion,"" she added.
Since pioneering the Prius in 1997, Toyota has sold more than 13 million hybrids, which twin a conventional gasoline engine and electric motor, saving fuel by capturing energy during coasting and breaking and using it to power the motor.
Hybrid vehicles account for around 3 percent of all vehicles sold globally, eclipsing the roughly 1.5 percent share of all-battery EVs, according to LMC Automotive.
Global automakers have pledged to electrify their offerings as a growing number of countries slash vehicle emissions by as much as half by 2030, but many say that shifting to fully electric cars will take time given high cost of batteries.
Lewis at Macquarie said automakers in China and Europe could be eager to access Toyota's hybrid-vehicle patents as they look for lower-emission vehicles to sell in lower-tier cities where costly battery EVs are out of reach for many drivers.
Toyota is also betting on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles as the ultimate zero-emissions vehicle, and as a result, has lagged many of its rivals in marketing all-battery EVs.
In 2015, it said it would allow access to its FCV-related patents through 2020.
","TOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. will offer free access to Toyota Motor Corp. hybrid-vehicle patents through 2030, Toyota Motor Corp. said on Wednesday, seeking to expand use of the lower-emission technology even as the global industry shifts toward full-electric cars.

""Toyota Motor Corp. want to contribute to an increase in take up (of electric cars) by offering not just Toyota Motor Corp. technology but Toyota Motor Corp. existing parts and systems to other vehicle makers.""
The Nikkei Asian Review first reported Toyota Motor Corp.'s plans to give royalty-free access to hybrid-vehicle patents.
"" Toyota Executive Vice President Shigeki Terashi said that the access excluded patents on "" Toyota Executive Vice President Shigeki Terashi lithium-ion battery technology.
Key technology
Toyota Motor Corp.'s move to unlock Toyota Motor Corp. patents underlines Toyota Motor Corp. belief that hybrids are an effective alternative to all-battery EVs, given a fuel efficiency roughly double that of gasoline cars, lower cost and that Toyota Motor Corp. do not need charging infrastructure.
Toyota Motor Corp. vehicles account for more than 80 percent of the global hybrid vehicle market.
""Toyota Motor Corp. has realized that Toyota Motor Corp. made a mistake by protecting Toyota Motor Corp. hybrid technology for years. This prevented diffusion"" said Janet Lewis, head of Asia transportation research at Macquarie Securities.
""Toyota Motor Corp. on Toyota Motor Corp. own can't get key technology accepted, but if other companies use key technology, that offers the best chance of expansion,"" she added.
Since pioneering the Prius in 1997, Toyota Motor Corp. has sold more than 13 million hybrids, which twin a conventional gasoline engine and electric motor, saving fuel by capturing energy during coasting and breaking and using it to power the motor.
Hybrid vehicles account for around 3 percent of all vehicles sold globally, eclipsing the roughly 1.5 percent share of all-battery EVs, according to LMC Automotive.
Global automakers have pledged to electrify Global automakers offerings as a growing number of countries slash vehicle emissions by as much as half by 2030, but many say that shifting to fully electric cars will take time given high cost of batteries.
Lewis at Macquarie said automakers in China and Europe could be eager to access Toyota Motor Corp.'s hybrid-vehicle patents as automakers in China and Europe look for lower-emission vehicles to sell in lower-tier cities where costly battery EVs are out of reach for many drivers.
Toyota Motor Corp. is also betting on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles as the ultimate zero-emissions vehicle, and as a result, has lagged many of Toyota Motor Corp. rivals in marketing all-battery EVs.
In 2015, Toyota Motor Corp. said Toyota Motor Corp. would allow access to Toyota Motor Corp. FCV-related patents through 2020.

Based on the trading of Tesla Inc.’s shares in the last 20 days, if a holder decided to convert their investment to stock, their’d receive a conversion value of $850 between cash and shares, instead of the $1,000 par value at maturity that Tesla would pay out fully in cash.
Tesla had about $3.7 billion of cash and equivalents as of Dec. 31, more than enough to make the principal payment plus another $1.15 million in interest. A representative for Tesla referred to comments in the company’s fourth-quarter shareholder letter, which said Tesla had “sufficient cash on hand to comfortably settle in cash our convertible bond that will mature in March 2019.”
Tesla Inc.’s shares haven’t closed above $359.87 since Dec. 14. When reporting fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 30, Tesla Inc.’s missed analysts’ estimates and said Tesla Inc.’s longtime CFO was resigning. More recently, Tesla Inc.’s critical Model 3 sedan lost a coveted recommendation from Consumer Reports, and Musk is running into regulatory trouble again because of Musk tweeting. The stock is down more than 10 percent this year.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked a judge on Monday to hold Musk in contempt for violating a settlement that required Musk to get Tesla approval before communicating material information to investors. That hasn’t stopped Musk from taking to Twitter again, with Musk latest posts hinting cryptically that Tesla will have news to share Thursday at 2 p.m. in California.
Should bondholders want to convert, Tesla said Tesla would settle the conversion with a 50-50 split of cash and stock, Bloomberg reported in December.
In another bizarre turn of events, Musk changed Musk Twitter display name to ""Elon Tusk"" in another late-night flurry of tweets on Wednesday, which also promised news from Tesla later this week.
In a series of tweets to his 25 million followers following charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this week, Musk accused the regulator of failing to read Tesla's annual reports and said Musk oversight was ""broken"".
On Wednesday, his changed his display name and added an elephant tag.
Social media platforms have featured a number of memes involving wordplay around Musk's name this week.
his also promised Tesla would have ""news"" at 2 p.m. California time on Thursday. The company, deep in debt as Tesla ramps up production of Tesla popular Model 3 sedan, is due to repay a $920 million convertible bond a day later.
Musk had promised last year to have Musk public statements vetted by Musk's board, as part of a settlement with the SEC that headed off demands for Musk to resign as Tesla CEO.
Tesla did not immediately respond to request for comment."

U.S. District Judge John Houston refused to dismiss the discrimination suit against Toyota San Diego, saying a trial is necessary to determine whether John Karczewski's request to accommodate his disability was reasonable.
Filed in 2014, the suit is one of 17 Americans with Disabilities Act cases Karczewski has brought in Southern California since 2013, including six against dealerships, federal court records show. Three of the dealerships have settled. Karczewski brought the rest of the cases against restaurants, other businesses and the city of San Diego.
In 2015, Houston dismissed the Toyota San Diego suit, but an appeals court reinstated it. The U.S. Justice Department filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Karczewski in the appeals court.
Toyota San Diego contends that installing temporary hand controls would violate federal safety regulations and the manufacturer's instructions.
The store argues that it would need to train its technicians to assist drivers and that installing hand controls would create a safety risk if customers aren't trained to use them.
Karczewski counters that technicians wouldn't need training ""because the installation doesn't require modification of the vehicle"" and that thousands of portable controls have been sold. He says some dealerships, including ones in California, provide hand controls for test drives.
In his decision, Houston said that determining whether it's reasonable to require dealerships to accommodate customers by installing portable hand controls depends on each situation. For example, it may be a reasonable requirement for large dealerships that regularly install hand controls, have universal hand controls available and employ technicians with expertise in installing them if a customer ""with clear expertise"" in using them makes an advance request.
However, it may be an ""unreasonably burdensome"" request for many other stores, Houston wrote in the decision. Another factor is the cost to the dealership, he said.
Toyota San Diego's lawyer, Aaron Jacoby of Los Angeles, noted that major manufacturers have mobility programs that allow customers to order properly equipped vehicles.
""Every manufacturer has made the hand controls available,"" he said. ""Every dealer has implemented the program.""
Brian Maas, president of the California New Car Dealers Association, said: ""The dispute in these cases is what's the appropriate legal standard for requiring dealers to perform an accommodation for a disabled customer who wants to engage in a test drive.""
The California association and the National Automobile Dealers Association filed a friend-of-the-court brief in one of Karczewski's other cases.
""We counsel our dealers to work with the disabled community,"" Maas said. ""If they want to test drive a vehicle, we're obviously interested in selling them cars.""
But he said dealers worry about the practical problems of stocking temporary controls for hundreds of vehicles.
Other concerns include ""assessing a customer's disability"" to determine what hand controls to install and the customer's ability to use them, as well as possible damage to a vehicle if temporary controls are improperly installed, Maas said.

The U.S. and the EU have been clinging to a fragile trade truce since July, when WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump and Juncker agreed to launch new trade talks. At the time, WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump promised not to impose new tariffs while new trade talks were ongoing.
But the trans-Atlantic tension between America and Europe was on full display at a security conference in Munich this weekend, where European diplomats gave Vice President Mike Pence a frosty welcome. German Chancellor Angela Merkel rejected the notion that European cars are a threat to U.S. national security, noting that many European models are built in America.
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has threatened levies of as much as 25 percent on foreign-made vehicles. Companies and governments from Europe to Asia have warned WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump that such tariffs would hurt the U.S. economy and disrupt the global auto industry.
On Monday the EU said that the EU will stick to the EU word not to impose new tariffs, as long as U.S. does the same. The 28-nation bloc is readying retaliatory tariffs totaling 20 billion euros ($22.7 billion) of U.S. goods should WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump follow through on WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump threat to impose duties on EU cars and auto parts.
Negotiations for a trade agreement have not officially started and the two sides are still at odds over the scope any deal would take. While U.S. U.S. insists agriculture should be part of the discussions -- and many key U.S. lawmakers have pressed the WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump administration to hold a firm line on the issue -- EU officials consider the topic off limits.

With Ford selling two trucks every minute and generating about $42 billion in revenue last year from the F-series alone, the MIT inventors are demanding an unspecified share of the proceeds. In a lawsuit filed Jan. 30, they say their patented dual port- and direct-injection technology were added to the company’s EcoBoost engines in recent years without permission.
The dispute marks a split in the long collaboration between MIT and Ford, which created a joint energy-research program in 2007 to focus on powertrain, fuel and energy technologies. A separate MIT Energy Initiative paired Ford personnel with university researchers. Chairman Bill Ford, great-grandson of the automaker’s founder Henry Ford, received a masters degree from the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1984.
But by 2015, the company suggested the professors were “greedy inventors” and refused offers to negotiate exclusive rights to license the patents, the lawsuit alleges.
Ford sells “a lot of vehicles, most with EcoBoost,” said Kevin Tynan, senior automotive analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence in Princeton, N.J., who estimates the company has sold about 8 million light trucks alone since 2015. It’s too soon to know how costly any royalties would be for the company, he said. “At $1 per vehicle, no big deal. At $1,000, $8 billion hurts a little.”
Spokespersons for Ford and MIT declined to comment on the case.
EcoBoost engines have been a key part of Ford’s strategy to develop cars and trucks with better fuel efficiency and power with fewer emissions, and they’ve been installed in millions of new vehicles over much of the past decade.
'Revolutionary throughout the industry'
MIT professors Leslie Bromberg, Daniel R. Cohn and John B. Heywood, who have been working for decades on improvements to internal-combustion engines, say they invented dual-injection technologies that allow for better fuel-and-air mixing and combustion stability than direct injection, with less engine knock.
“Revolutionary throughout the industry,” is how MIT describes the technologies, which have been cited by more than 115 other patents, including dozens by Ford, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in Wilmington, Del.
The professors transferred ownership of their creations to MIT, one of the premier U.S. research universities, which then granted exclusive patent-licensing rights to a small company the three men founded, Ethanol Boosting Systems LLC. EBS offered to license patents on the enhancements to Ford in 2014, but the company declined.
Since then, the technologies have become integrated into new EcoBoost engines Ford is promoting in recent models, including F-150 trucks, Lincoln Navigator SUVs and Ford Mustang sports cars, according to the plaintiffs.
Licensing questions
Heywood, who was director of the Sloan Automotive Laboratory at MIT and wrote the 1988 textbook “Internal Combustion Engine Fundamentals,” emailed two Ford executives in October 2014 to discuss licensing the dual-injection technology, according to the complaint. Heywood cited MIT’s history with Ford and wrote that EBS “would like to give Ford the first opportunity” to license a portfolio of five patents, one of which is named in the lawsuit.
After a volley of emails, Bill Coughlin, then Ford’s chief intellectual-property officer, agreed to meet at MIT in April 2015.

EBS invited Ford to analyze the patents and identify any that weren’t applicable to its products, but that never happened, the plaintiffs allege. After more rounds of emails and phone calls, including with Greg Brown, then the counsel for global engine intellectual property at Ford Global Technologies LLC, the carmaker told EBS in November 2015 that it wasn’t interested in licensing the patents.
Asked whether Ford might be interested in the technology for future vehicles, Brown, according to the complaint, “indicated that Ford had no plans that he knew of to use that technology in its vehicles.”
'Imminent plans'
But Ford “did have imminent plans” to use the technology, and “already was incorporating that technology into its engines and fuel-management systems,” MIT and EBS said in the lawsuit. The complaint cites a June 2017 press release in which Ford said it was using dual port- and direct-injection technology in its 3.5-liter EcoBoost engines and other engines that are available in the F-150, Expedition and other models.
The majority of Ford trucks, and 60 percent of F-150s, have EcoBoost engines, Hau Thai-Tang, Ford’s executive vice president of product development and purchasing, said Jan. 15 at the Wolfe Research Global Auto Industry Conference.
“We sold 1 million F-series last year,” Thai-Tang said. “Our PR team did the math. We sell one every 29 seconds.”

FCA is already letting Gladiator prospects configure it online, but no pricing details are available."", ""4"": ""Nielsen, 61, dealer principal for Nielsen Automotive Group in northern New Jersey, spoke with Staff Reporter Vince Bond Jr. last month about his expectations for the Gladiator, a three-row Grand Cherokee, the sales success of the Challenger and the possibility of a wide-body Charger. Here are edited excerpts."", ""5"": ""Q: What is the biggest challenge facing FCA dealers?"", ""6"": ""A: I think the biggest challenge we're going to face in the coming years is having capacity to service, maintain and keep these customers in house to change oil and stuff. We're on track to have a banner year at FCA if this month closes out pretty well. A lot of demand in the service bays. It's been a good year. I think it will continue into next year. The product has been great. We're on track to have a certain amount of gain this year where other manufacturers are flat or down."", ""7"": ""You said the service bays have been busy. Is that a product of marketing and having good specials?"", ""8"": ""We're pretty consistent with Mopar and trying to keep them in house and not trying to lose them to the Pep Boys and Jiffy Lubes of the world. I think it's a lot of effort on the dealers' part to keep them in house and not go down and get their brakes done at Meineke, and then come back to us for something they're not capable of doing. We can do it all. That's a challenge to keep them in house and have enough technicians to do that."", ""9"": ""The Gladiator was shown at the L.A. show. How do you feel about its design and overall capabilities?"", ""10"": ""I've had a lot of calls and people walking in inquiring about it. People like a niche vehicle."", ""11"": ""Do you think the Gladiator will pull from Wrangler sales?"", ""12"": ""I don't think it will affect the Wrangler business. I think it's going to compete with the midsize pickup truck for people who want to have something different."", ""13"": ""What's a good price for the Gladiator? The sweet spot?"", ""14"": ""The sweet spot is under $60,000. I think there is a market out there for it. People determine what it's worth. I think it will come in and come out."", ""15"": ""Wrangler is having another record year. It's a great product, people like it, it's very versatile. When we went from two to four doors, it opened up a whole new market of people who never could buy a Wrangler because it didn't fit their family. I sell Wrangler to lawyers and teenagers. It's a great mix and we do a lot of leasing in the Northeast. They can take the roof down, or go through the snow with it. It fits in a lot of people's eyes. It's functional, rugged four-wheel-drive. It fits in all age brackets. It fits a broad base of customers."", ""16"": ""The Wrangler's days supply has been building up in recent months. What do you think is happening there?"", ""17"": ""They don't really share those [days supply] numbers with us, the dealers. My days supply is probably a little above normal, but we built two models there for a while. The old one and the new one. We've had a couple issues with wheels and tires from the suppliers that haven't fit everybody's needs. Once spring breaks here in the Northeast with that car, they'll be begging for it again. It's just getting on track. There's been a pretty decent demand for that car. I've taken pretty much every one I could get."", ""18"": ""We've built capacity and just need to continue to adjust to it. I don't think there's an issue for that car at all. We were building the old one and ramping up the new one, so you had a double barrel coming at you. We have a little value on the older one and, with the new one, we're just trying to get our feet wet to what the consumer wants."", ""19"": ""Do you think the Gladiator will have a similar reception as the Hellcats?"", ""20"": ""I truly believe that. I think the first ones will be big demand for fancy [trims], a lot of equipment. I don't sell many base-model Wranglers. A lot of hardtops, a lot of equipment, navigation, leather. I think when you are in the perceived price range of the Gladiator, I think it's going to be more of a higher-end vehicle. I think you'll be trading BMW, Mercedes and European cars for the Gladiator."", ""21"": ""FCA is going to build a three-row Jeep Grand Cherokee in a few years. Is that the right car, for the right time?"", ""22"": ""The Grand Cherokee keeps on clicking. In the Northeast, Grand Cherokee and Cherokee. Those are our two volume products. People really enjoy that car. It fits their needs. It's a great lease market for SUVs here. It's always been the top SUV here in the Northeast. It holds its own across the country."", ""23"": ""Will that third row open it up to new customers?"", ""24"": ""Sure. It will appeal to other people that haven't considered it. If you could ever please 100 percent of the people with one car, you'd be a genius. People who love this car today might hate the new one. You have to roll with it and see how it goes. It still has a name. It's still a Jeep, it's still a Grand Cherokee."", ""25"": ""Do you think the Fiat and Chrysler brands will survive much longer in the U.S.?"", ""26"": ""I think there is room to grow the brands. Chrysler and Fiat both need new product. Fiat makes a good car, we just need some different models. What's happened across the industry, sedans have gone down, you've got to play in the SUV market a little more. Both those brands need a little something to get them pumped up again. The customer is looking for a smaller, midsize or subcompact SUV or some kind of crossover."", ""27"": ""Sedan sales have been down across the industry, but the Dodge Challenger is actually up this year. Why do you think that car is defying the trend?"", ""28"": ""We make an all-wheel-drive Challenger. You get here in the Northeast, it's four-wheel drive. It's more appealing. It's priced aggressively, it's a good value for the money. They keep it fresh, there's always a new look or a new package. It fits a lot of different needs for the limited amount of people in that segment. I sell mostly, if it's not a Hellcat, a GT model, which is all-wheel drive."", ""29"": ""How are the wide-body Challengers doing?"", ""30"": ""It's a little seasonal for me. It was 9 degrees here this morning. That car doesn't do good in the colder weather. I probably can't compete with a guy in Florida, but I do sell a fair amount in the summer. It's a little more seasonal."", ""31"": ""What are your thoughts on a wide-body Charger? Would that be enticing?"", ""32"": ""I think it would be low volume, but I think it can be sold. It would just have to make sense for the company. We'll sell it, but can we sell enough across the country to keep the plant going and make some money?"", ""33"": ""What can FCA do to build momentum for Alfa Romeo?"", ""34"": ""I'm not an Alfa Romeo dealer, but I think it's product. More SUVs is what I'm hearing from these guys. The products it has seem to be selling really well."", ""35"": ""Any product holes for Jeep or Ram that you want filled?"", ""36"": ""I don't think so. I think they've done a great job of keeping it fresh. The amount of competitors' trucks that I trade on Ram is nothing short of amazing. It's a great truck.

In fact, the New Jersey dealer believes the Gladiator will generate a Hellcat-like fervor for a brand that's already selling record numbers.
Nielsen, chairman of the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles National Dealer Council, says the sweet spot for the long-awaited pickup will be under $60,000. FCA is already letting Gladiator prospects configure it online, but no pricing details are available.
Nielsen, 61, dealer principal for Nielsen Automotive Group in northern New Jersey, spoke with Staff Reporter Vince Bond Jr. last month about his expectations for the Gladiator, a three-row Grand Cherokee, the sales success of the Challenger and the possibility of a wide-body Charger. Here are edited excerpts.
Q: What is the biggest challenge facing FCA dealers?
A: I think the biggest challenge we're going to face in the coming years is having capacity to service, maintain and keep these customers in house to change oil and stuff. We're on track to have a banner year at FCA if this month closes out pretty well. A lot of demand in the service bays. It's been a good year. I think it will continue into next year. The product has been great. We're on track to have a certain amount of gain this year where other manufacturers are flat or down.
You said the service bays have been busy. Is that a product of marketing and having good specials?
We're pretty consistent with Mopar and trying to keep them in house and not trying to lose them to the Pep Boys and Jiffy Lubes of the world. I think it's a lot of effort on the dealers' part to keep them in house and not go down and get their brakes done at Meineke, and then come back to us for something they're not capable of doing. We can do it all. That's a challenge to keep them in house and have enough technicians to do that.
The Gladiator was shown at the L.A. show. How do you feel about its design and overall capabilities?
I've had a lot of calls and people walking in inquiring about it. People like a niche vehicle.
Do you think the Gladiator will pull from Wrangler sales?
I don't think it will affect the Wrangler business. I think it's going to compete with the midsize pickup truck for people who want to have something different.
What's a good price for the Gladiator? The sweet spot?
The sweet spot is under $60,000. I think there is a market out there for it. People determine what it's worth. I think it will come in and come out.
Wrangler is having another record year. It's a great product, people like it, it's very versatile. When we went from two to four doors, it opened up a whole new market of people who never could buy a Wrangler because it didn't fit their family. I sell Wrangler to lawyers and teenagers. It's a great mix and we do a lot of leasing in the Northeast. They can take the roof down, or go through the snow with it. It fits in a lot of people's eyes. It's functional, rugged four-wheel-drive. It fits in all age brackets. It fits a broad base of customers.
The Wrangler's days supply has been building up in recent months. What do you think is happening there?
They don't really share those [days supply] numbers with us, the dealers. My days supply is probably a little above normal, but we built two models there for a while. The old one and the new one. We've had a couple issues with wheels and tires from the suppliers that haven't fit everybody's needs. Once spring breaks here in the Northeast with that car, they'll be begging for it again. It's just getting on track. There's been a pretty decent demand for that car. I've taken pretty much every one I could get.
We've built capacity and just need to continue to adjust to it. I don't think there's an issue for that car at all. We were building the old one and ramping up the new one, so you had a double barrel coming at you. We have a little value on the older one and, with the new one, we're just trying to get our feet wet to what the consumer wants.
Do you think the Gladiator will have a similar reception as the Hellcats?
I truly believe that. I think the first ones will be big demand for fancy [trims], a lot of equipment. I don't sell many base-model Wranglers. A lot of hardtops, a lot of equipment, navigation, leather. I think when you are in the perceived price range of the Gladiator, I think it's going to be more of a higher-end vehicle. I think you'll be trading BMW, Mercedes and European cars for the Gladiator.
FCA is going to build a three-row Jeep Grand Cherokee in a few years. Is that the right car, for the right time?
The Grand Cherokee keeps on clicking. In the Northeast, Grand Cherokee and Cherokee. Those are our two volume products. People really enjoy that car. It fits their needs. It's a great lease market for SUVs here. It's always been the top SUV here in the Northeast. It holds its own across the country.
Will that third row open it up to new customers?
Sure. It will appeal to other people that haven't considered it. If you could ever please 100 percent of the people with one car, you'd be a genius. People who love this car today might hate the new one. You have to roll with it and see how it goes. It still has a name. It's still a Jeep, it's still a Grand Cherokee.
Do you think the Fiat and Chrysler brands will survive much longer in the U.S.?
I think there is room to grow the brands. Chrysler and Fiat both need new product. Fiat makes a good car, we just need some different models. What's happened across the industry, sedans have gone down, you've got to play in the SUV market a little more. Both those brands need a little something to get them pumped up again. The customer is looking for a smaller, midsize or subcompact SUV or some kind of crossover.
Sedan sales have been down across the industry, but the Dodge Challenger is actually up this year. Why do you think that car is defying the trend?
We make an all-wheel-drive Challenger. You get here in the Northeast, it's four-wheel drive. It's more appealing. It's priced aggressively, it's a good value for the money. They keep it fresh, there's always a new look or a new package. It fits a lot of different needs for the limited amount of people in that segment. I sell mostly, if it's not a Hellcat, a GT model, which is all-wheel drive.
How are the wide-body Challengers doing?
It's a little seasonal for me. It was 9 degrees here this morning. That car doesn't do good in the colder weather. I probably can't compete with a guy in Florida, but I do sell a fair amount in the summer. It's a little more seasonal.
What are your thoughts on a wide-body Charger? Would that be enticing?
I think it would be low volume, but I think it can be sold. It would just have to make sense for the company. We'll sell it, but can we sell enough across the country to keep the plant going and make some money?
What can FCA do to build momentum for Alfa Romeo?
I'm not an Alfa Romeo dealer, but I think it's product. More SUVs is what I'm hearing from these guys. The products it has seem to be selling really well.
Any product holes for Jeep or Ram that you want filled?
I don't think so. I think they've done a great job of keeping it fresh. The amount of competitors' trucks that I trade on Ram is nothing short of amazing. It's a great truck. With Reid Bigland and these guys, they are great marketers. They know how to do business.
How are incentives looking for Rams right now?
The whole segment is aggressive. I think Ford is most aggressive, then Ram falls in there and General Motors comes in and out. It's a very profitable segment for the manufacturers. They need to be in it and they need to be competitive. People expect quality, and they expect good value with the quality.
Does FCA do a good job of communicating with its dealers?
I think the communication is great, especially with the dealer council. I've been on for quite a few years, three or four meetings a year, monthly calls. They try to update the dealer body before they run to [the media] and announce what's going on. They have an open-door policy. Here's a guy, Reid Bigland, who sits in on all of our meetings and calls. I think they communicate well. Our internal system for email and announcements and stuff is pretty good. I don't think there's an issue with communication. They're not afraid to say no. Reid will tell you ""yes,"" ""no"" or ""we're working on it.""
As far as marketing, is the company hitting the right marks?
Everybody is a marketing genius, I guess. But at the end of the day, we're advertising five brands. It's different when you're just Ford or Hyundai or whatever the case may be. I think we do a pretty good job of doing the best we can with what we have. They make good spots and show the equipment. I think that's all you can ask for. They're very involved in the Internet side of it and all that stuff that goes along with analytics, keywords.

He spoke with Staff Reporter Michael Wayland about the council's work on Pinnacle, the ousting of former Cadillac President Johan de Nysschen and continuing challenges for the brand. Here are edited excerpts."", ""6"": ""Q: What are your priorities as Cadillac's national dealer council chairman?"", ""7"": ""A: I've been on the council now for a year. My priorities are the dealers, and our No. 1 priority is profitability. Every meeting we have had over the last year, we've put that as No. 1 on our agenda to talk about. Basically, any of the direction or topics that we're reviewing is a forefront for our endeavors to enable dealers to become more profitable."", ""8"": ""Has Project Pinnacle helped dealer profitability?"", ""9"": ""Pinnacle is starting to take hold; it has taken hold through 2018. It's delivering what Johan [de Nysschen], when he introduced Pinnacle, promised. Cadillac dealers have been more profitable through '18 than they have been in prior periods. We've seen some growth with profitability and honestly with the introduction of XT4 and the onslaught of products that takes place in 2019, we're anticipating that will continue to grow."", ""10"": ""So dealers have settled into Project Pinnacle?"", ""11"": ""Yes, they have. We launched it effectively in early '17. There's a lot of work that went into it prior to that, and yeah, whenever you impose a change of that magnitude on an entire dealer body, there's a lot of give and take. And a lot of work on both sides. It seemed like when it was launched in '17, there was a lot of learning that was going on at a dealership level. Through '18, it seems like we have the basics down pretty well and it's really starting to work well for us."", ""12"": ""Now that we have a lot of the brand standards in place at our stores, that's pretty much second nature for us and we've been focusing more on the objectives of the program and how to make that effective for our dealerships, which in our case is reward payments. It's really played out to our benefit in 2018."", ""13"": ""What were changes you wanted to concentrate on heading into 2019 for Project Pinnacle?"", ""14"": ""At this point with Pinnacle, we're down to really tweaks and we've had some minor changes among the brand standards.

It launched in October-November, our first full month, and it immediately shot to No. 1 in the segment. I think we've got some great things coming with that vehicle."", ""28"": ""Do you think Cadillac is too late to the game for crossovers like the XT4? Or will demand for that segment continue to grow?"", ""29"": ""No. Everything I've seen in that segment or any of the crossover segments, continues down the road. Yeah, I think, as a dealer, we always think the manufacturer comes too late with products. However, I think Cadillac has shown that they can come to the market relatively quickly, evidence by the XT4 coming out and immediately being a success."", ""30"": ""How important is it to have a product like the Cadillac XT6 coming to help fill the gap between the XT5 and Escalade?"", ""31"": ""That gap between the XT5 and Escalade, in my opinion, is a very important gap. We see what the other luxury manufacturers have in their portfolios and for us that's a huge area. We talk to customers every day that love the look of the XT5 and they, of course, love the Escalade. But the Escalade's just a little too big for them but they need three rows of seats, and they go elsewhere to buy vehicles in that gap."", ""32"": ""In November, GM announced the Cadillac CT6 would be ending production this year in the U.S. What are your thoughts on potentially losing that car?"", ""33"": ""I don't feel good about it.

I would just say I'm not excited about CT6 potentially going away."", ""34"": ""How has Super Cruise, which is currently exclusively offered on the CT6, been received in the marketplace?"", ""35"": ""Super Cruise has been fantastic. There's talk everywhere right now of autonomous driving. It seemed to me to be a little slow getting off the ground but pretty quickly on, after it was launched, we had people that came into the store and they were asking for test drives of that vehicle with Super Cruise. It quickly ramped up and 30 percent of our CT6s nationally have Super Cruise on them. It's a great product."", ""36"": ""GM announced plans to begin expanding Super Cruise across Cadillac's lineup, followed by other brands, beginning in 2020. As it grows across the Cadillac portfolio, can it be a differentiator for Cadillac?"", ""37"": ""I'm very excited about it rolling out the product because we've had customers who want the XT5 but they want Super Cruise too and we had to tell them that's only available on CT6. So yeah, I'm really excited about that."", ""38"": ""Do you feel Cadillac dealers are adequately prepared to enter new mobility segments and sell new technologies such as Super Cruise or electric vehicles?"", ""39"": ""Yes, we are. Whenever we launch any new technology, Cadillac has pretty much been at the forefront of it and they have typically been out at our stores well in advance of the product coming along with the actual technologies. We have training that's required for all the people that deal with both the product and customers. We've been ahead of the game pretty much all the way down the road."", ""40"": ""New-car margins are getting squeezed throughout the industry. What are Cadillac dealerships doing to help profitability and reduce expenses?"", ""41"": ""Pinnacle launched in 2017. That was a whole new dynamic as to how the dealers had to approach profitability form a front-end standpoint because our margins changed and a lot of the prior front-end profit translated into Pinnacle bonuses, if you will."", ""42"": ""So we had to take a look at how we paid our people, all the way from salesmen to managers. I think the heavy lifting for that was all done in '17. We've tweaked some of the things going through '18 but aside from the changes in '17, I don't see dealers really, other than doing their normal expense reviews in '18, I don't see a huge changes."", ""43"": ""Is vehicle affordability a concern for Cadillac dealers and their customers?"", ""44"": ""Right now, I do not see that as being an objection to a lot of our customers. Again, being a dealer, we always think the manufacturer overprices their vehicles. It doesn't appear that anybody is really pricing themselves out of the market, so no, I think we're OK right now."", ""45"": ""Are rising interest rates affecting Cadillac dealerships?"", ""46"": ""Yes, they are. The cost of flooring our vehicles has gone up and that's a concern for us. It requires that we watch our days supply closely, as we always do, but it's even more important in a rising interest environment."", ""47"": ""Are Cadillac and GM Financial doing anything to help mitigate challenges created by higher rates?"", ""48"": ""I have not seen a change from GM Financial on how they might mitigate that expense."", ""49"": ""What was dealer reaction to GM replacing de Nysschen with Steve Carlisle as Cadillac's president?"", ""50"": ""Johan was a very polarizing individual. I think probably the response that I heard was 50/50. Some people loved Johan, other ones not so much."", ""51"": ""The dealers, with the change of bringing Steve in, most of the dealers in the U.S. didn't know Steve Carlisle or don't know him. So, I think they're sitting back right now with the wait and see approach. Let's see what he brings to us."", ""52"": ""They saw him for the first time [in September] at the dealer conference in Las Vegas and the dealers that I talked to out there that had met him and had listened to his presentation were all pretty upbeat about it."", ""53"": ""What are your thoughts on Carlisle as Cadillac president?"", ""54"": ""I've had a lot of interaction with Steve since he's come on board. I'm very excited about having Steve at the helm of Cadillac. Steve is not as flamboyant, but he is a very intelligent, articulate individual and I think he's going to do great things for Cadillac."", ""55"": ""Cadillac's marketing has become more upbeat in recent months. How do you and other dealers feel about the new messaging?"", ""56"": ""I'm hearing applause from the dealers I have heard from, and thank God for that. The changes are more than welcome. I think the New York campaign, when it was launched, served a purpose. I think it was getting a little stale, in my viewpoint. This new campaign is fantastic.""}","The Cadillac XT4 marked the beginning of a long-promised product renaissance for the American luxury brand that will continue with a new or redesigned vehicle every six months on average through 2020.

The biggest concern for the brand's 900-plus retailers this year remains profitability, according to David Butler, Cadillac's new national dealer council chairman.
Cadillac dealers, Butler said, are beginning to experience profit growth under Project Pinnacle, the brand's overhaul of dealership operations that marks its second full year in 2019, but overall sales remain below expectations — something he hopes upcoming products will correct.
Butler, 64, is executive manager of the Suburban Collection, a Michigan-based dealership group with 36 automobile brands in 54 retail locations in Michigan and California. He spoke with Staff Reporter Michael Wayland about the council's work on Pinnacle, the ousting of former Cadillac President Johan de Nysschen and continuing challenges for the brand. Here are edited excerpts.
Q: What are your priorities as Cadillac's national dealer council chairman?
A: I've been on the council now for a year. My priorities are the dealers, and our No. 1 priority is profitability. Every meeting we have had over the last year, we've put that as No. 1 on our agenda to talk about. Basically, any of the direction or topics that we're reviewing is a forefront for our endeavors to enable dealers to become more profitable.
Has Project Pinnacle helped dealer profitability?
Pinnacle is starting to take hold; it has taken hold through 2018. It's delivering what Johan [de Nysschen], when he introduced Pinnacle, promised. Cadillac dealers have been more profitable through '18 than they have been in prior periods. We've seen some growth with profitability and honestly with the introduction of XT4 and the onslaught of products that takes place in 2019, we're anticipating that will continue to grow.
So dealers have settled into Project Pinnacle?
Yes, they have. We launched it effectively in early '17. There's a lot of work that went into it prior to that, and yeah, whenever you impose a change of that magnitude on an entire dealer body, there's a lot of give and take. And a lot of work on both sides. It seemed like when it was launched in '17, there was a lot of learning that was going on at a dealership level. Through '18, it seems like we have the basics down pretty well and it's really starting to work well for us.
Now that we have a lot of the brand standards in place at our stores, that's pretty much second nature for us and we've been focusing more on the objectives of the program and how to make that effective for our dealerships, which in our case is reward payments. It's really played out to our benefit in 2018.
What were changes you wanted to concentrate on heading into 2019 for Project Pinnacle?
At this point with Pinnacle, we're down to really tweaks and we've had some minor changes among the brand standards. Some that come in, some that go out. We're learning from experience on those and what's important. Those weren't really one of the achievements that the council wanted, it's just the question of what Cadillac wants to change and what we agree with for those changes.
The big changes are really revolving around how the retail objectives come into play. We're going form a quarterly objective program to a monthly in 2019. Another change that we made was we adjusted how the objectives for CPO are set. It's something that the dealers wanted to get done.
Is Cadillac doing enough to promote and support CPO through Pinnacle?
As a dealer, we always say they could do more for us. We'd like something in play every month but if you do have something every month, it gets stale. So, Cadillac has found a way to mix it up, if you will, and come at different times in the year with promotions and advertising.
How was 2018 for Cadillac dealers?
I was a little disappointed in it. I expected our sales to grow a little bit more than where we ended up.
What are your expectations and priorities for Cadillac dealers in '19?
I'm going to say profitability, and along with profitability goes throughput at our stores. I think with the onslaught of product coming at us, we all expect to grow sales. That's a critical component of profitability at this point for us.
Any expectations on how much Cadillac sales can grow in 2019?
We haven't really worked out a 2019 plan. I think we're going to be jumping into that in January. I don't know Cadillac's expectations yet.
Cadillac dealers finally got a compact crossover to sell with the arrival of the XT4 in the fall. How important is that product to future growth? How have sales been thus far?
With any launch vehicle, dealers want it quicker and the manufacturers want to make sure that it's right. We also want to make sure it's right too, but it came to market a little later than we wanted it to. We were making sure the quality was right on that car.
But the acceptance in our showrooms, everything that I've seen at my stores and the dealers I've talked to, has been phenomenal. Customers are delighted with the vehicle. We have a new sense of excitement in our stores with the XT4 there.
We're very pleased with the XT4. It launched in October-November, our first full month, and it immediately shot to No. 1 in the segment. I think we've got some great things coming with that vehicle.
Do you think Cadillac is too late to the game for crossovers like the XT4? Or will demand for that segment continue to grow?
No. Everything I've seen in that segment or any of the crossover segments, continues down the road. Yeah, I think, as a dealer, we always think the manufacturer comes too late with products. However, I think Cadillac has shown that they can come to the market relatively quickly, evidence by the XT4 coming out and immediately being a success.
How important is it to have a product like the Cadillac XT6 coming to help fill the gap between the XT5 and Escalade?
That gap between the XT5 and Escalade, in my opinion, is a very important gap. We see what the other luxury manufacturers have in their portfolios and for us that's a huge area. We talk to customers every day that love the look of the XT5 and they, of course, love the Escalade. But the Escalade's just a little too big for them but they need three rows of seats, and they go elsewhere to buy vehicles in that gap.
In November, GM announced the Cadillac CT6 would be ending production this year in the U.S. What are your thoughts on potentially losing that car?
I don't feel good about it. The CT6, from my standpoint, is a very successful vehicle. I would just say I'm not excited about CT6 potentially going away.
How has Super Cruise, which is currently exclusively offered on the CT6, been received in the marketplace?
Super Cruise has been fantastic. There's talk everywhere right now of autonomous driving. It seemed to me to be a little slow getting off the ground but pretty quickly on, after it was launched, we had people that came into the store and they were asking for test drives of that vehicle with Super Cruise. It quickly ramped up and 30 percent of our CT6s nationally have Super Cruise on them. It's a great product.
GM announced plans to begin expanding Super Cruise across Cadillac's lineup, followed by other brands, beginning in 2020. As it grows across the Cadillac portfolio, can it be a differentiator for Cadillac?
I'm very excited about it rolling out the product because we've had customers who want the XT5 but they want Super Cruise too and we had to tell them that's only available on CT6. So yeah, I'm really excited about that.
Do you feel Cadillac dealers are adequately prepared to enter new mobility segments and sell new technologies such as Super Cruise or electric vehicles?
Yes, we are. Whenever we launch any new technology, Cadillac has pretty much been at the forefront of it and they have typically been out at our stores well in advance of the product coming along with the actual technologies. We have training that's required for all the people that deal with both the product and customers. We've been ahead of the game pretty much all the way down the road.
New-car margins are getting squeezed throughout the industry. What are Cadillac dealerships doing to help profitability and reduce expenses?
Pinnacle launched in 2017. That was a whole new dynamic as to how the dealers had to approach profitability form a front-end standpoint because our margins changed and a lot of the prior front-end profit translated into Pinnacle bonuses, if you will.
So we had to take a look at how we paid our people, all the way from salesmen to managers. I think the heavy lifting for that was all done in '17. We've tweaked some of the things going through '18 but aside from the changes in '17, I don't see dealers really, other than doing their normal expense reviews in '18, I don't see a huge changes.
Is vehicle affordability a concern for Cadillac dealers and their customers?
Right now, I do not see that as being an objection to a lot of our customers. Again, being a dealer, we always think the manufacturer overprices their vehicles. It doesn't appear that anybody is really pricing themselves out of the market, so no, I think we're OK right now.
Are rising interest rates affecting Cadillac dealerships?
Yes, they are. The cost of flooring our vehicles has gone up and that's a concern for us. It requires that we watch our days supply closely, as we always do, but it's even more important in a rising interest environment.
Are Cadillac and GM Financial doing anything to help mitigate challenges created by higher rates?
I have not seen a change from GM Financial on how they might mitigate that expense.
What was dealer reaction to GM replacing de Nysschen with Steve Carlisle as Cadillac's president?
Johan was a very polarizing individual. I think probably the response that I heard was 50/50. Some people loved Johan, other ones not so much.
The dealers, with the change of bringing Steve in, most of the dealers in the U.S. didn't know Steve Carlisle or don't know him. So, I think they're sitting back right now with the wait and see approach. Let's see what he brings to us.
They saw him for the first time [in September] at the dealer conference in Las Vegas and the dealers that I talked to out there that had met him and had listened to his presentation were all pretty upbeat about it.
What are your thoughts on Carlisle as Cadillac president?
I've had a lot of interaction with Steve since he's come on board. I'm very excited about having Steve at the helm of Cadillac. Steve is not as flamboyant, but he is a very intelligent, articulate individual and I think he's going to do great things for Cadillac.
Cadillac's marketing has become more upbeat in recent months. How do you and other dealers feel about the new messaging?
I'm hearing applause from the dealers I have heard from, and thank God for that. The changes are more than welcome. I think the New York campaign, when it was launched, served a purpose. I think it was getting a little stale, in my viewpoint. This new campaign is fantastic.","The Cadillac XT4 marked the beginning of a long-promised product renaissance for the American luxury brand that will continue with a new or redesigned vehicle every six months on average through 2020.

In an interview following Dias’ press conference, Paterson downplayed the significance of the blockade and said he “felt bad” for Unifor members who have stood in cold, snowy and rainy conditions.
“There’s nobody in the building today,” he said. “Basically, it’s a protest outside an empty building. I think the urgency, given that, is probably overstated.”
Paterson said GM Canada considers Unifor’s blockade to be illegal, and the automaker could consider taking legal action in response. He said GM has asked local police to stop protesters from blocking the road to the headquarters, though he was unaware as of Wednesday afternoon if the company had filed for an injunction.
“I believe this is an illegal action, so we’ll see how long they’re there,” Paterson said. “I honestly don’t know what our legal staff will do on that, but I presume from experience where Unifor has done this before, generally it’s agreed it’s an illegal action. In past instances, where they’ve done this before, there have been injunctions that have been secured.
An Ontario Superior Court judge ruled in 2008 that a nearly two-week blockade of GM Canada’s headquarters by the Canadian Auto Workers, a predecessor of Unifor’s, that year was illegal. That blockade was in response to GM announcing that it would close its Oshawa truck assembly plant, which would shutter in 2009.
“We’ve been saying for several weeks that we would like the union to sit down and discuss the packages that will be made for affected workers at the Oshawa plant over the next year,” Paterson said. “Until these types of actions are done, that’s not really possible until Unifor is ready to come to the table.”
‘IT’S GOING TO GET UGLY’
Dias said the blockade would be a sustained effort, lasting beyond Wednesday and again threatened to escalate Unifor’s battle with GM.
“It’s going to get ugly and it is going to get ugly very quickly,” Dias said. “The bottom line is we’re not going away.”
Dias said he was set to meet Wednesday morning with officials in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office to discuss the Oshawa plant. He said he would urge the federal government to get more involved in its fight with GM and said he ultimately wants a meeting between himself, Trudeau and GM CEO Mary Barra.
“I’m looking to get the federal government engaged immediately,” Dias said. “It’s past time.”
Barra met with Navdeep Bains, the federal minister of innovation, science and economic development, in Detroit last week. Bains said he urged GM to reverse course on its Oshawa plans, though Barra said the decision was final.
A Unifor spokeswoman said non-GM employees who work at the company’s Canadian headquarters will be allowed in by union members. Paterson said non-GM tenants of the building include Ontario Power Generation Inc. and cafeteria services.
Oshawa Assembly is one of three North American assembly plants GM plans to stop allocating production to in 2019 as part of a larger corporate restructuring. Oshawa builds the Cadillac XTS and Chevrolet Impala sedans and does final assembly on previous-generation Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup bodies shipped from the United States.","TORONTO — Unifor members on Wednesday morning formed a blockade outside of General Motors’ Canadian headquarters in Ontario, to protest the automaker’s plans to end production at the nearby assembly plant in Oshawa.
Unifor President Jerry Dias said the automaker’s the automaker’s would prevent GM Canada employees from entering the building. The move is in response to GM Canada’s plans to stop allocating products to Oshawa Assembly beyond 2019.
“GM headquarters will be down and “GM headquarters will stay down,” Unifor President Jerry Dias said. “This is going to become a very major community initiative for us.”
David Paterson, GM Canada vice president of corporate and environmental affairs, said GM Canada employees would work from home Wednesday and that the automaker’s operations would be unaffected. David Paterson, GM Canada vice president of corporate and environmental affairs estimated about 700 GM Canada employees work at “GM headquarters.
“us have the ability to work from home or at other locations, so us won’t be affected,” Paterson said. “us’ll have planned for this and have alternate arrangements.”
ESCALATING PROTESTS
Unifor’s action is the latest in an escalating feud between the union and GM Canada. Unifor has undertaken an international campaign to save the Oshawa plant, taking out advertising in GM Canada and the United States and staging protests that briefly halted production at the factory and at one of Unifor nearby suppliers. GM Canada, meanwhile, has taken to social media to refute claims by Unifor that GM Canada is moving the Oshawa jobs to Mexico and has repeatedly urged the union to work with GM Canada on securing new jobs for workers.
The war of words continued on Wednesday afternoon. During a news conference at the blockade, Dias said Unifor’s actions would happen on an ongoing basis at different GM Canada facilities and suppliers.
“What is happening here today is going to happen tomorrow,” Dias said “ItUnifor’s going to happen on Friday. ItUnifor’s going to happen at different locations, General Motors. We’re going to see you at the [Detroit] auto show that runs until the 27th. The simple reality is that We’re not going to stop.”
Dias said Unifor's actions would not include an outright boycott of all GM products.
""I'll never call for an outright boycott,Dias Dias said. ""Our members in Ingersoll make the incredible Equinox. Our members in Ingersoll provide powertrains for so many different vehicles that are sold in the United States.

Company executives said Tuesday they are looking to identify a location in the southeast section of the state, where they'll hire as many as 400 employees over the next five years to install its self-driving systems on vehicles produced by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Jaguar.
Waymo is partnering with global supplier Magna to integrate the systems on vehicles, with a team hired exclusively for the work on the Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans and Jaguar I-Pace electric vehicles the company plans on using as it expands autonomous operations in the years ahead.
""As we begin to commercialize our business and vehicle supply grows, we're laying the foundation for a scalable, robust vehicle integration plan, starting in Michigan,"" the company said in a statement.
Waymo plans to move into the space by the midpoint of this year, company executives said, and the program is expected to be operational by 2024.
The Michigan Economic Development Corp., a public-private partnership agency that works to recruit businesses, helped broker a deal to land Waymo's expansion in the state. The project is supported by an $2 million grant from the Michigan Strategic Fund that covers the first 100 jobs — about $20,000 each — upon signing a lease for no less than three years, the MEDC said in a statement to Crain’s Detroit Business, an affiliate of Automotive News. Waymo could then qualify for $20,000 for each new job at the site up to 400 new jobs or an additional $6 million in grants.


Waymo is expected to make a $13.6 million capital investment in what's expected to be as much as a 200,000-square-foot facility, per the documents.
A Waymo spokesperson says the company would likely look to repurpose an existing space rather than develop a new facility from the ground up.
Waymo already has a facility staffed with 20 employees located in the Detroit suburb of Novi, which the company opened in October 2017 to house vehicles used for testing throughout snowy winters and in other adverse weather conditions.

Part of Nissan's investigation into the scandal, which has led to Ghosn's arrest and removal as chairman, focuses on how some U.S. franchises were awarded.
Under review is a California group run by an associate of the Saudi businessman at the center of breach-of-trust allegations against Ghosn.
Meanwhile, one of the ousted Nissan chairman's closest allies and one of the automaker's most powerful executives, Jose Munoz, quit his job as chief performance officer late last week after having been given a leave of absence.
Munoz's sudden sidelining had many U.S. dealers worried about Nissan's retail strategy. The company is fine-tuning an overhaul of his often-controversial U.S. dealer incentive programs.
Nissan's contentious calculus of spiffs and stair-step incentives is undergoing a rocky transition under CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who is trying to break with Nissan's past sales practices. Munoz handed off direct control of North America last year to look after China. But as the company's chief performance officer he maintained global oversight and represented a powerful voice for the U.S. in the top management at headquarters in Yokohama.
Munoz, 53, also had been envisioned by some as a possible successor to Saikawa.
""It's a tremendous loss to the dealer body,"" said Ray Brandt, Nissan National Dealer Advisory Board member and CEO of Ray Brandt Auto Group in Harvey, La. ""I am very concerned.""
Nissan North America executives discussed the Munoz's sidelining in Yokohama with the dealer board during a regularly scheduled conference call last week, before Munoz's resignation.
""They assured us that all of our resources and the direction we're going is still in place,"" dealer board Chairman Tim Hill and owner of Hill Nissan in Winter Haven, Fla., told Automotive News.
Separately, as part of its probe of potential misconduct related to Ghosn, Nissan is scrutinizing the awarding of franchises to Trophy Automotive Dealer Group, a person familiar with the matter said. Headquartered in Glendale, Calif., Trophy Automotive has six stores in Southern California. Two are Nissan outlets, two sell Kia and two sell Mercedes-Benz.
The person offered no further details about the investigation, noting it is in its early stages. It was unclear whether Munoz's leave was related. Neither Munoz nor Trophy Automotive has been accused of wrongdoing.
Trophy Automotive was founded in 2014, the same year Munoz was named chairman of Nissan North America.
Trophy Automotive is under scrutiny because its CEO, Nasser Watar, is a business associate of Khaled Al Juffali, the person familiar with the matter said. Juffali is the Saudi businessman identified by Tokyo prosecutors as a key figure in their breach-of-trust investigation against Ghosn. The prosecutors allege that Ghosn arranged payment of $14.7 million from a Nissan subsidiary to a company owned by Juffali to help Ghosn settle millions of dollars of personal losses on currency swap contracts concerning his executive compensation.
Watar and Juffali are joint owners of Al-Dahana which, in turn, owns 50 percent of Nissan Gulf, the regional distributor for Nissan and Infiniti in several Middle Eastern countries.
Ghosn and Juffali have denied any misconduct or kickback scheme.
Phone calls and emails seeking comment from the general managers of Trophy Automotive's two Nissan stores, George Khabbaz of West Covina Nissan in West Covina, Calif., and Tom Awada of Universal City Nissan in Los Angeles, went unanswered. A woman who answered the phone at Trophy Automotive's head office and identified herself as the group's legal assistant declined immediate comment, saying the company would first have to look into the matter.
Nissan also declined to comment on the matter.
The new dealer issue indicates that Ghosn's legal saga in Japan is spilling into operations worldwide.
One source said Nissan has a team of 100 people scouring the company for evidence of possible misconduct linked to Ghosn's long tenure as head of the automaker. A person familiar with the probe said Nissan is ordering especially close audits of operations in the Middle East, Latin America and Asia.
Munoz is not the only high-level executive affected by the investigation. Senior Vice President Arun Bajaj, who heads human resources at Nissan and is senior vice president of talent development at the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, is on a leave of absence.
Bajaj is cooperating with Japanese prosecutors in their investigation of Ghosn, a person familiar with the matter said. When asked by Automotive News about his status, Bajaj said, ""I'm staying out of it. No comment."" One source said Bajaj was expected to eventually return to work.
One Nissan insider called the sidelining of Munoz and Bajaj a ""purge"" of influential Ghosn-era executives, after Ghosn's stunning Nov. 19 arrest in Japan and removal as Nissan's chairman.
Munoz, who ran Nissan's North American business before being given responsibility for sales results around the world, cited the internal investigation of Ghosn in his resignation.
The Spaniard aggressively drove the company's controversial multi-year drive to boost its U.S. market share to 10 percent in accordance with Ghosn's orders, angering many dealers along the way.
He also blamed Nissan's widening investigation of past Ghosn activities, for diverting the company's focus.
Munoz had been scheduled to unveil the extended-range Leaf electric vehicle last week at CES in Las Vegas, but his appearance was scrubbed. While on leave, Munoz was asked by Nissan not to come into his office, a person familiar with his status said.
Two people familiar with the matter said Munoz was not sufficiently cooperating with Nissan's probe against Ghosn. One source said Nissan was also questioning Munoz's role in awarding supplier contracts, including one with a parts maker in Mexico.
Munoz, a native of Spain, is believed to have not visited Japan since leaving the country in late November, shortly after Ghosn's arrest.
Munoz was frequently cited as a possible successor to Saikawa. Indeed, Saikawa named Munoz chairman of Nissan's business in China — the automaker's biggest market, but a key region where Munoz lacked deep experience. The move was seen as part of his grooming for the top post.
But Saikawa and Munoz didn't always see eye to eye, especially over U.S. growth strategy.
It fell to Munoz to execute Ghosn's aggressive 2011 midterm business plan in North America, Power 88. The plan targeted an 8 percent operating profit margin and 8 percent global market share.
Nissan missed those, but Munoz in select months delivered another top goal of the plan: a 10 percent U.S. market share, a gain of more than 3 percentage points from the plan's starting point, a feat many critics doubted was possible.

A new round of soul searching is underway.
On one side are dealers who backed Munoz's aggressive strategy. On the other are those supporting Saikawa's kinder, gentler approach, despite some growing pains from it.
Munoz won loyalty among Nissan Group's approximately 1,300-dealer retail community for his chipper demeanor, never-quit work ethic and accessibility, his fans say.
Wayne Siegel, owner of Legend Auto Group in Amityville, N.Y., and also a member of the Nissan National Dealer Advisory Board, said Munoz's departure is ""more traumatic for the dealers than they imagine.

""They're starting to become forthcoming,"" National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Administrator Mark Rosekind told an audience of consumer advocates. ""My understanding is that yesterday, things started changing around."" he added, without elaborating.
NHTSA slapped the $14,000-per-day fine on Takata last month for failing to cooperate fully with its probe of airbag inflators that have been linked to at least six deaths and dozens of injuries. The devices, which can explode and spray metal shards into passenger compartments, have resulted in 17 million vehicle recalls in the United States alone.
The government accused Takata of dumping more than 2.4 million pages of documents on the NHTSA without any guide to or explanation of the content.
Despite new signs of cooperation, Rosekind said it would take several meetings between NHTSA and Takata representatives to change the situation significantly.
""I'm not sure they're far enough yet,"" he said at a meeting of the Consumer Federation of America.
Roseking, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, took NHTSA's helm in December amid expectations that he would make the auto regulator more responsive to defect issues following its slow response to recent problem with Takata and General Motors ignition switches.
He pointed to the Takata case as an example of NHTSA's ""willingness to stand up and fight on behalf of the consumer"" and said the Obama administration will seek new authority from Congress to impose stiffer civil and criminal penalties.
""We are taking any actions allowed under the law to hold manufacturers accountable. But it's clear to any unbiased observer that the law does not currently provide our agency with sufficient authority to hold bad actors fully accountable,"" said Rosekind.
Rosekind also said he would address longstanding consumer complaints that NHTSA is too close to industry to be effective, a problem for which critics blame a ""revolving door"" of personnel between the agency and the private sector.
""I'm not going to support anything except our neutrality and independence and protecting the consumers,"" he said.
""I can't control who leaves, but I'll control who comes in and I'm at the top making the decisions.""","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Takata Corp., under pressure from a $14,000 daily fine from U.S. regulators, has started to become more cooperative about documents involving a deadly defect in Takata Corp. airbag inflators, NHTSA said on Friday.
""They're starting to become forthcoming,"" National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Administrator Mark Rosekind told an audience of consumer advocates. ""My understanding is that yesterday, things started changing around."" he added, without elaborating.
NHTSA slapped the $14,000-per-day fine on Takata last month for failing to cooperate fully with NHTSA probe of airbag inflators that have been linked to at least six deaths and dozens of injuries. The devices, which can explode and spray metal shards into passenger compartments, have resulted in 17 million vehicle recalls in the United States alone.
the United States accused Takata of dumping more than 2.4 million pages of documents on NHTSA NHTSA without any guide to or explanation of the content.
Despite new signs of cooperation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Administrator Mark Rosekind said National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Administrator Mark Rosekind would take several meetings between NHTSA and Takata representatives to change the situation significantly.
""I'm not sure NHTSA and Takata representatives're far enough yet,"" National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Administrator Mark Rosekind said at a meeting of the Consumer Federation of America.

But let's be honest, now that we've had four months to deal with what happened at the end of July: Marchionne's frenetic, nonstop pace extracted much too heavy a toll on the man himself.
With the appointment Thursday of two outsiders to key executive roles -- Mark Stewart as COO of FCA North America and Niel Golightly as global chief communications officer -- Marchionne's successor, FCA CEO Mike Manley, has made it abundantly clear that he has learned another tough lesson from his late boss.
The role Stewart assumes is no entry-level job. Marchionne himself was COO for FCA in North America until his death in July, when it became one of many titles unfortunately thrust upon Manley.
Under FCA's byzantine management structure, the COOs for each of the company's regions are responsible for almost everything that occurs there. And since North America is now FCA's most profitable region by far -- the profit margin in the region surged to 10.2 percent in the third quarter -- driving the performance of the company as a whole, the North American COO job is absolutely vital.

That may be true, but no other automaker ever copied it, and with good reason: It's exhausting, maybe even life-draining.
At 51, Stewart is just a few months younger than FCA CFO Richard Palmer, Tim Kuniskis, head of the Jeep and Alfa Romeo brands, and Reid Bigland, who heads FCA Canada, U.S. sales and the Ram brand. Palmer, Kuniskis and Bigland will all have turned 52 by the end of February, while Manley is only 54. While Stewart's year as an executive at Amazon will grab the headlines, his long background with Tower Automotive and later as an executive with TRW and ZF TRW are what's likely to help him most in Auburn Hills, Mich.
Manley already has a full plate of issues to deal with at FCA: straightening out operations in China, righting the profitability ship at Maserati and boosting profitability out of Europe and Latin America. The last thing he needs to worry about is North America.
Luckily for him, FCA's North American operations are running about as well as they could right now, as evidenced by that hefty profit margin.
That means it's as good a time as any to pass the baton.","Sergio Marchionne was easily the busiest automotive CEO in generations. Sergio Marchionne traveled constantly. Sergio Marchionne worked endlessly. Sergio Marchionne noodled, Sergio Marchionne argued, Sergio Marchionne debated, Sergio Marchionne contemplated, Sergio Marchionne engaged -- really whatever verb you'd like to use for heavy decision-making -- without end.
But let's be honest, now that we've had four months to deal with what happened at the end of July: Sergio Marchionne's frenetic, nonstop pace extracted much too heavy a toll on the man himself.
With the appointment Thursday of two outsiders to key executive roles -- Mark Stewart as COO of FCA North America and Niel Golightly as global chief communications officer -- Marchionne's successor, FCA CEO Mike Manley, has made it abundantly clear that Sergio Marchionne has learned another tough lesson from Sergio Marchionne late boss.
The role Mark Stewart assumes is no entry-level job. Sergio Marchionne was COO for FCA in North America until Sergio Marchionne death in July, when Sergio Marchionne became one of many titles unfortunately thrust upon Manley.
Under FCA's byzantine management structure, the COOs for each of the company's regions are responsible for almost everything that occurs there. And since North America is now FCA's most profitable region by far -- the profit margin in FCA's most profitable region surged to 10.2 percent in the third quarter -- driving the performance of the company as a whole, the North American COO job is absolutely vital.
Sergio Marchionne viewed Fiat Chrysler's cross-connecting executive matrix -- the management structure that has the same executives shouldering multiple key global roles -- as a key strength, a way to make and implement decisions ""at the speed of light.""

Is interior-centric design just about anticipating self-driving cars, or are there other reasons to move in that direction?
The discussion of ""interior first"" for car design has been around since before I was in school in the '70s, but rarely is there a project that allows the designers to break free of so many canons of brand-driven design and really explore the consequences, as was the case with Reds.

The decision is irrational.
Given the severe challenges confronting the Chinese economy, including slowing demand for new cars and light trucks, the government should reduce the tax as soon as possible, rather than sit idle and do nothing.
U.S. tariffs, along with deep-rooted internal problems such as debt-laden state-owned enterprises and unfavorable policy treatment of private businesses, has weakened the Chinese economy.
In the third quarter, economic growth across China slowed to 6.5 percent from 6.8 percent in the first half.
Amid the slowing domestic economy, China's new light-vehicle deliveries dropped for the fourth straight month, slumping 13 percent year on year to below 2.05 million in October.
Why has the car market slowed considerably in an economy that is still growing?
It has much to do with the high costs of car purchases and ownership in China.
When buying new cars, Chinese consumers must pay a value-added tax and a consumption tax, the same taxes they pay for other goods. They also have to pay custom duties when buying imported vehicles.
That's fair enough. But they must also pay a tax that is specifically levied on vehicle purchases. The tax on a new vehicle stands at 10 percent of the price.
In addition, buyers also pay an annual property tax for car ownership, which varies from 180 yuan ($26) to 4,500 yuan, depending on the size of the vehicle's engine.
But those are not the only expenses tied to car ownership.
Most car owners in Chinese cities live in apartment buildings and do not have private parking lots. So they also have to pay parking fees that can run several thousand yuan a year, in addition to regular outlays for gasoline, maintenance and insurance.
All these constitute a sizable portion of expenditures for average car-owning Chinese families.
With the national economy rapidly losing steam, Chinese consumers are scrambling to cut discretionary spending. Because of high associated costs, a new car is more likely than other items to be removed from a consumer's shopping list.
With the Trump administration slapping punitive tariffs on a sweeping range of Chinese goods, Beijing is now seeking to reinvigorate the national economy by boosting domestic consumption.
For that purpose, it will lower personal income tax starting at the beginning of next year.
In fact, the Chinese government slashed the vehicle purchase tax in the past whenever demand in the domestic car market showed signs of slight weakening -- it halved the tax for engine displacements of up to 1.6 liters in 2009 and 2016.
It is perplexing to see the government keep the vehicle purchase tax intact when the downturn of the domestic light-vehicle market has accelerated at a speed never seen before.

He is the former president of General Motors Indonesia, past managing director for China at J.D. Power, and author of  American Wheels, Chinese Roads.
Every few days I get a call from an automotive executive looking for a straight answer: ""When are the Chinese coming?""
In recent days, the questions have become more pointed: ""Are the Chinese even coming at all? Won't the Trump tariffs stop them all dead in their tracks?""
But the narrative of Chinese auto firms arriving in the U.S. market is an unusual one, different from how Japanese and Korean companies entered North America. In the 1980s and 1990s, the likes of Toyota, Nissan, Honda and Hyundai first exported from home, then built transplants in the U.S. Over time, the automakers were followed by their families of suppliers. Then came r&d centers.
With the Chinese, entry into the U.S. is happening in reverse order. You already can find scores of Chinese suppliers employing tens of thousands of people at manufacturing locations all along the I-75 corridor. And Silicon Valley is dotted with Chinese tech firms developing world-class expertise in electric and autonomous vehicles.
So where are the automakers?
It is true that we see no Chinese cars on American roads, unless you count Volvo. But several Chinese OEMs quietly operate r&d centers in Michigan and San Jose and Los Angeles. The American and Chinese executives working at the design centers are preparing Chinese products for American consumers.
There are other signs that the Chinese are serious. Chinese leaders created a strategic blueprint for the future called Made in China 2025. The goal: dominate key technologies — electric vehicles, autonomous tech, 5G, robotics and artificial intelligence. By 2025, China plans to produce 5 million electric cars a year — half the world's expected total.
To lead in tomorrow's technologies, China needed access to breeding grounds for new tech, places such as Silicon Valley, Michigan and Southern Germany. Chinese officials are clearly encouraging their companies to go global.
When the Made in China 2025 policy was unveiled in 2015, I felt that we were at the beginning of an important new chapter. A giant wave of Chinese companies would soon be pouring into the U.S., Europe and other markets.
So my family of five moved from our home in Asia since 1990 to California, and I formed ZoZo Go to enjoy the ride.
I did not have to wait long. By early 2016, my team of researchers had identified 51 Chinese automakers, suppliers and auto-tech firms with operations in America. Today, that number has more than doubled to 105.
Think of Chinese automotive companies operating in America in three categories: suppliers, tech companies and automakers.
Suppliers: Home away from home
Lining the I-75 manufacturing corridor from Michigan to Georgia are scores of Chinese parts suppliers. They make a range of components including glass, suspension systems, bearings, airbags, tires, sealing parts, anti-vibration components, batteries for electric vehicles, instrument panels, stampings, magnesium die-cast components and power steering systems.
They include leading Chinese supplier names that North American auto executives will want to get familiar with: Wanxiang, Joyson, Fuyao, Yanfeng and Beijing West Industries (BWI).
How did these companies become ensconced in America's manufacturing heartland? Many started out by simply delivering parts to GM, Ford and FCA assembly operations in China in the early 2000s. Now they are present on U.S. soil and supplying the Detroit Three directly. The towns and counties of the Midwest and South are becoming their home away from home.
Chinese firms also have acquired several U.S. suppliers as part of their global expansion strategy. Some examples: Nexteer, Key Safety Systems, Henniges, Meridian Magnesium and A123 Systems.


Tech companies: California base camps
Drive Highway 101 from San Jose to San Francisco, the backbone of Silicon Valley, and you will discover an intense concentration of American auto technology genius: Tesla, Nvidia, Waymo, Intel-Mobileye, Zoox and Cruise.
Much less apparent is the widening net of Chinese electric vehicle and autonomous vehicle companies operating in California.
In the EV space, Chinese-owned SF Motors, BYD, Faraday, Byton and NYSE-listed Nio employ thousands of high-paid Silicon Valley engineers to help them build world-class vehicles.
In the autonomous vehicle arena, you will discover r&d base camps run by several Chinese firms. Of the 59 companies that have permits to test autonomous cars in California, 14 are Chinese-owned.
Leaders in autonomous vehicle research include the Chinese companies Baidu (referred to as ""the Google of China""), Pony.ai, Roadstar.ai and TuSimple. Didi (called ""the Uber of China"") operates a self-driving lab in Sunnyvale.
For these companies, the new name of the game is to ""r&d in California and commercialize in China."" Once the business is established in their home market, Chinese tech leaders will promote their products and services globally.


Automakers: Prepping entry
It is true that we do not see Chinese-brand cars on U.S. roads — at least not yet. But several major Chinese automakers are actively laying the groundwork for market entry.
Shanghai Auto, Beijing Auto, Geely, Changan, Guangzhou Auto, BYD and Great Wall all have established centers for design and commercial development, mostly in California and Michigan.
Look for the first Chinese cars on American streets in late 2020.
Why not earlier? Trade friction.
The Trump administration's tariffs on Chinese imports have altered the equation, eliminating the companies' export-from-China option. Instead, we can expect Chinese manufacturers to do precisely what Japanese and Korean automakers did to facilitate sales: build assembly factories in North America.
Will the Chinese stay home for a while longer as a result of the trade tensions? Not likely. China's car market has peaked. The days of head-turning growth and profits there are over. China is home to 40 million units of capacity, some 10 million of which is currently idle. They have no choice but to push out.
U.S.-China disputes over trade, currency manipulation, intellectual property and more will no doubt slow the pace of Chinese automotive investment in America.
They already have. But with so many Chinese companies already woven into the fabric of U.S. industry, there is no reversing the trend.

Cruisin' to a standstill According to a Reuters report, General Motors' Cruise Automation self-driving car program has encountered technical issues that could delay plans to deploy a robot taxi service in 2019. Sources told Reuters that Cruise's vehicles struggle to identify whether objects are in motion or are pedestrians and will mistakenly identify ""phantom"" bicycles, leading to erratic maneuvers.
Separately, Faraday Future's outlook is getting worse, as the company made several cost-cutting measures, including slashing some employees' salaries by 20 percent and laying off others.
No joke Turns out Dyson, the British electronics appliance company, was being serious when the company expressed interest in building an electric car. The company will build a vehicle factory in Singapore by 2020.
Separately, a taxi company plans to introduce self-driving taxis onto London streets by 2021.

Many tough challenges remain, and many bumps in the road still lie ahead. But I find myself more optimistic today than I would have expected. Though a naturally skeptical person, I somehow feel more awe at the pace of technological progress now than I did the first time I rode in a self-driving car. It's a strange place to be, but It somehow feels right.
-- Edward Niedermeyer
