When the 48-volt drive is combined with a diesel engine as in its first production application, there is an additional effect.

Further production ramp-ups are soon to be set in motion on the basis of a modular system for 48-volt drives.
The 48-volt technology is regarded as a technology of the future, as the low voltage compared with conventional hybrid vehicles enables considerable savings in fuel consumption in return for moderate additional costs. Consequently, Continental anticipates that market penetration will be rapid, with four million vehicles with low-voltage hybrid drives to be produced worldwide in 2020. For 2030, the technology supplier's experts forecast a global market of as many as 25 million new vehicles. During development of the modular system, the engineers at Continental therefore placed great emphasis on achieving a high degree of efficiency for the overall system, simple adaptation to existing vehicle powertrain designs, and highly automated, cost-effective production.

The efficiency of a 48-volt system is largely dependent on the amount of drive and recovery output available in continuous operation. As a result, Continental has chosen to employ a water-cooled induction motor that can be connected directly to the engine's cooling circuit. This makes it possible to assemble a machine that, depending on the version, can continuously provide an output of six kilowatts and torque of 60 newton meters, all in the installation space of a conventional starter alternator. Using a belt drive means that up to 150 newton meters can be transmitted to the crankshaft. Within the modular system, only the length of the motor changes the power. The inverter, based on a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), is integrated in the housing lid, which saves space. the modular system also includes a DC/DC converter, which enables the 48-volt system to be connected to the vehicle's on-board power supply. This makes it possible to use some of the energy stored in the lithium-ion battery to stabilize the on-board power supply as well. Simple adaptation to existing powertrain designs is a major benefit of the P0 concept that Continental has pursued. Simple adaptation to existing powertrain designs enables the load point of the combustion engine to be shifted. The fuel savings demonstrated in test vehicles are considerable, with a figure of 13 percent in the New European Driving Cycle. In real-world use – especially in cities – The fuel savings demonstrated in test vehicles are even higher thanks to the greater share of driving spent in energy recuperation phases, and can reach up to 21 percent. This is helped by the fact that the combustion engine can be switched off when the vehicle approaches traffic lights, starting at speeds below 20 km/h. the combustion engine is always started with the 48-volt drive within just 0.2 seconds – a conventional starter needs roughly twice as much time. When the 48-volt drive is combined with a diesel engine as in the 48-volt drive first production application, there is an additional effect. This is that the nitrogen oxide emissions produced during acceleration from low engine speeds fall by up to 10 percent, as some of the necessary torque is generated via the electric motor.

To enable cost-effective production at high volumes, Continental has developed new processes for manufacturing the electric motor. For example, the copper wire for the stator is not wound but comprises individual copper rods. Combined with innovative connection technology, this design enables not only highly automated production but also greater packing density, and thus more output from the same installation space.Even after the start of production, Continental will continue to develop the 48-volt technology. As well as optimizing all components for the P0 arrangement, the focus will be on another system configuration, for with the P2 arrangement, the electric motor is located between the engine and the transmission. the electric motor can therefore be operated entirely independently of the combustion engine, which means that electric driving at speeds of temporarily up to 50 km/h is possible with a 48-volt drive as well. Such a solution, which enables fuel savings of up to 25 percent in concert with additional efficiency-boosting measures, was presented for the first time by Continental and Schaeffler at the 2016 Vienna Motor Symposium.

Continental is intensifying its ongoing activities in the fleet management service business and is acquiring a majority stake in the smart fleet management technology provider Zonar. This venture has the potential to chart the course of the future of smart fleet management globally. The contract was signed on September 23rd and has obtained the required vote of the shareholders, but remains subject to final approval of the US Federal Trade Commission and US Department of Justice. Daimler Trucks North America LLC confirms its continuous commitment to the company and is retaining its minority stake. Zonar, headquartered in Seattle, USA, employs a staff of over 300. Zonar is a technology solution provider that offers a range of fleet management offerings to public and private commercial vehicle fleets in North America. With the investment in Zonar by Continental, the two enterprises will combine their complementary strengths to become a major supplier in the sector and further expand both companies’ portfolios to offer additional smart fleet solutions to the market.
“With this move, we are further expanding our portfolio and expertise in the arena of mobility services, and fostering our regional balance by investing into a fleet management provider in the US that gives us access to a broad customer base and existing sales channels”, said Helmut Matschi, President of the Interior Division and Member of the Executive Board of Continental.
“It is exciting to move into a new chapter in Zonar history with the backing of a respected global brand that recognizes our need to serve our markets as a nimble, innovative, customer-focused company as we have for the past 15 years,” said Ian McKerlich, President of Zonar. “Customers will receive the same productive partnership and innovation they have come to expect with Zonar, as well as expanded technological resources and capabilities from Continental.
Established in 2001, Zonar pioneered smart fleet telematics with patented and award-winning operations technology across all commercial transportation markets: commercial trucking, vocational and passenger fleets. The complete suite of solutions drives safety, efficiency and fuel savings—from drivers to dispatch to administrative operations. Notable patents include the only Electronic Verified Inspection Reporting system available today, which ensures pre- and post-trip inspection compliance. The company’s tablet technology is AOBRD self-certified and ELD-ready. Zonar is also the exclusive OEM partner for Daimler Trucks North America’s Virtual Technician solution installed on more than 200,000 Daimler trucks.
“Through the integration of new smart technology solutions, we can enhance our existing fleet management services.  In addition, with regard to remote diagnostics for commercial vehicles, we can broaden our existing Continental diagnostics capabilities through new backend services,” added Dr. Michael Ruf, Head of the Commercial Vehicle & Aftermarket Business Unit at Continental, where the acquisition will be integrated.
“Continental’s investment in Zonar presents a great opportunity to bring the best in both hardware and software solutions to the industry.  Daimler Trucks North America will continue its partnership with Zonar building upon the success we have enjoyed over the last 5 years and Zonar will continue to be an integral part of our connectivity solutions,” said Martin Daum, President and CEO, Daimler Trucks North America.
When the process is complete, Continental will further expand its already existing product, solution and service portfolio in the area of mobility services for fleet management of commercial vehicles and aftermarket.","Continental Invests a Majority Stake in Smart Fleet Management Technology Provider Zonar

Hanover, September 2016. Software is the new wheel of industry, but in the logistics sector, this wheel is evidently not quite turning properly yet. According to the “Continental Mobility Study 2016”, an abundance of very different standards, interfaces, and systems is creating a lack of clarity and excessive strain on the market. As a result, more than half of the logisticians surveyed in the study fear that the industry could get left behind as digitalization progresses. A fifth see no opportunities for the sector in digitalization. Meanwhile, 9% of logisticians even say that they cannot think of anything relating to digitalization happening yet.
""Too expensive, too big, too sluggish, too dependent on data centers, not mobile-compatible, not user-optimized, stand-alone solutions,"" according to one summary of criticism leveled at the services on offer. ""For us, that means that we have to make our own adjustments and find a software solution for every customer.

That incorporates being open to other manufacturers as well"", says the study, as well as ""We value independence.

At present, only 25% of respondents have software solutions for fleet management on their wishlists. The top priorities are fuel-saving technologies and advanced driver assistance systems, with 66% in favor of each. However, tracking for individual goods, or software for logistics management are also rated as important. Their importance tends to be considered greater in China than in Germany. Slightly less than half of companies do not use such software at all; this applies to small companies in particular. ""Fleet management is not yet in place. However, it is highly relevant to mixed fleets of purchased and leased vehicles, as well as those of subcontractors,"" comments one fleet manager.
Software applications that directly involve drivers enjoy significantly higher acceptance.Some 61% of logistics experts surveyed regard software for road performance as very important, the figures rising to 66% for software to be used by drivers and 85% for software to aid driver comfort and convenience. However, roughly a third of companies do not use such applications. Where applications are used, they overwhelmingly meet with satisfaction.

The logistics experts therefore agree that applying a strategy of ""keep doing what we're doing"" is not possible in the long term. ""There needs to be a revolution in the industry if development continues as it is doing,"" says one study participant.
In fact, almost the entire industry is working to capacity as a result of tough competition and, in its own view, has barely any resources to commit to innovation. Only 16 percent of the drivers in ther international long-distance haulage receive special incentives when driving especially fuel-efficient. The experts say that the situation is particularly difficult for small and medium-sized transport companies. Although they are aware of the necessity of connectivity and digitalization, they are under such pressure in their day-to-day business that they have neither the time nor the budget to give much thought to the future or to plan investments. They have little room for creativity anyway; moreover, innovations need to pay off within just one or two years if companies are to survive the competition.
They also have to deal with competition from global players in online commerce, which are establishing their own logistics organizations, as well as dealing with the problems that many small and medium-sized enterprises are having finding dedicated, forward-thinking corporate successors. ""This trend will intensify. The big companies will get bigger, because their costs look better and they can cross-subsidize divisions. The big companies are also more open to innovations and are better able to adapt them"", surmises a spokesperson for an association.
Meanwhile, the experts surveyed believe that competition in Europe is influenced primarily by participants from central and eastern European EU states. ""In some cases, scandalous working conditions prevail, with a minimum wage of €2.80. This all relies on EU legislation. One significant problem is the free movement of services within the EU, which does not include any obligation to maintain a branch in a state, nor is it bound to any such obligation,"" comments one industry expert. According to the expert, this also leads to a situation in which more highly qualified and specialized drivers are used for domestic and regional transport, while the trend is the opposite in long-distance haulage.
Furthermore, in Germany, there is a transport infrastructure that receives good grades from only 9% of logistics experts surveyed in the study. More than 90% say that roads, bridges, ports, and railways in Germany are not well developed.

Fragmentation: even large companies have only very small market shares
Industry sees a need for action, particularly in matters of environmental protection
Continental Mobility Study makes clear that intense cost pressure leaves little room for innovations with lasting effect
Hanover, September 2016. ""In the transport business, the slices of the pie are distributed and the customer dictates the price"" – this quote from a logistics expert in the Continental Mobility Study 2016 gets to the heart of the situation in the industry. The suggestion that cost pressure, which is enormous in any case, will continue to intensify finds agreement from 88% of logisticians surveyed. At the same time, 84% consider 84% not especially well positioned for the future. By contrast, 74% are thoroughly positive when it comes to the future of 74% own companies. In China, logisticians rate the industry in logisticians as being in a better position overall. With regard to 74% own companies, however, only 63% of Chinese respondents are optimistic about the future.
In fact, freight transport is experiencing dramatic growth. In 2010, approximately 265 billion metric ton-kilometers were moved on the road in Germany, and experts anticipate that this figure will rise to more than 370 billion by 2050. One reason for this, say the experts, is the enormous growth in Internet commerce. With approximately €132 billion in online sales generated in Europe in 2013, a total of roughly €250 billion is expected in 2017 – almost doubling in just five years. In Germany, sales in online retail are projected to rise from almost €53 billion in 2015 to €73 billion in 2017.
According to the experts surveyed, the Internet shipments are also becoming increasingly small-scale, while customers are demanding the shortest possible delivery times. Furthermore, freight transport – that is, import, export, and through transport – is growing, as are the distances between suppliers and recipients. However, the increase in freight and delivery transport by road runs counter to stricter environmental specifications. CO2emissions produced by freight traffic on the roads amounted to approximately 1.1 billion metric tons worldwide in 2010. Experts project that this figure will quadruple to roughly 4.5 billion metric tons by 2050. Experts therefore agree that applying a strategy of ""keep doing what we're doing"" is not possible in the long term.

The ContiPressureCheck system is also compatible with a range of telematics systems, which means that tire pressure and temperature data can be viewed on an integrated display and transmitted to external devices. For fleets, this results in instant transparency and improves tire management.
The ContiPressureCheck system also helps to reduce fuel consumption and tire wear, thereby increasing mileage. The increased fuel-efficiency of trucks and the longer service life of their tires reduce fleet operating costs. ContiPressureCheck also helps to improve sustainability thanks to reduced CO2 emissions, while optimum tire pressure enhances the safety of all road users.
The iTire portfolio is growing all the time. ContiPressureCheck sensors can also be purchased separately and installed in the tires by customers.

Around 20 percent of accidents involving trucks with pedestrians or cyclists occur when the vehicle is turning right – and this is why Continental, the international technology company decided to develop a system that assists truck drivers on right turns, making the roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists. ProViu®Detect detects the positions of road users and actively warns the driver when there is a risk of collision – also reducing the driver’s stress levels in complex traffic situations. “The right turn is one of the most difficult tasks in city traffic. ProViu®Detect eliminates this blind spot, giving drivers a flexible system that’s also designed to meet any future legal requirements,” explains Dr. Michael Ruf, Head of Business Unit Commercial Vehicles & Aftermarket at Continental."", ""6_p"": ""ProViu®Detect has a complex algorithm that uses sensor data to detect pedestrians and cyclists and can show them on an onboard display. The system locates the road users and calculates the time until a possible collision could occur, based on the vehicle location. The advantage of this active system is that it first assesses whether or not the situation is critical. If there is a danger of collision, ProViu®Detect then uses for example a pulsating LED light strip in the vehicle cabin or an acoustic warning signal to warn the driver of the danger. The Continental experts can implement the different warning strategies upon request.

Assistance system determines the position of pedestrians and cyclists and warns of any collision risks
Robust solution – complex algorithm detects critical driving situations
Adaptive warning strategy and warning signals can be flexibly parameterized to match customer requirements
Development is designed to meet future legal requirements
Hanover, September 2016. Around 20 percent of accidents involving trucks with pedestrians or cyclists occur when the vehicle is turning right – and this is why Continental, the international technology company decided to develop a system that assists truck drivers on right turns, making the roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists. ProViu®Detect detects the positions of road users and actively warns the driver when there is a risk of collision – also reducing the driver’s stress levels in complex traffic situations. “The right turn is one of the most difficult tasks in city traffic. ProViu®Detect eliminates this blind spot, giving drivers a flexible system that’s also designed to meet any future legal requirements,” explains Dr. Michael Ruf, Head of Business Unit Commercial Vehicles & Aftermarket at Continental.
ProViu®Detect has a complex algorithm that uses sensor data to detect pedestrians and cyclists and can show them on an onboard display. The system locates the road users and calculates the time until a possible collision could occur, based on the vehicle location. The advantage of this active system is that it first assesses whether or not the situation is critical. If there is a danger of collision, ProViu®Detect then uses for example a pulsating LED light strip in the vehicle cabin or an acoustic warning signal to warn the driver of the danger. The Continental experts can implement the different warning strategies upon request. A high-resolution sensor also ensures that ProViu®Detect reliably identifies objects in the surrounding environment.
The system’s range of functions can be upgraded with various options and an adaptive, risk-sensitive concept that warns the driver in two stages is also available. Where required, the developers can also exploit synergies within the Continental Group to supplement the system with radar sensors. In combination with the already-proven camera systems ProViu®360 for all-round vehicle visibility and ProViu®Mirror, the digital wing mirror replacement, ProViu®Detect considerably increases driving safety levels.

The pre-installed sensors not only save fleet operators valuable installation time, but also mounting costs and Continental ensure that the sensors are correctly installed and positioned within the tires. Currently, 22 of the major tire sizes – especially those in the Conti Hybrid and Conti EcoPlus tire lines – are available as iTire tires.
Data measured inside the tires is continuously recorded and displayed to the driver on a screen. If the tire pressure deviates from the target value, ContiPressureCheck alerts the driver immediately. This allows measures aimed at resolving the problem and returning the tire pressure to its normal value to be taken immediately.
The ContiPressureCheck system is also compatible with a range of telematics systems, which means that tire pressure and temperature data can be viewed on an integrated display and transmitted to external devices. For fleets, this results in instant transparency and improves tire management.
The ContiPressureCheck system also helps to reduce fuel consumption and tire wear, thereby increasing mileage. The increased fuel-efficiency of trucks and the longer service life of their tires reduce fleet operating costs. ContiPressureCheck also helps to improve sustainability thanks to reduced CO2 emissions, while optimum tire pressure enhances the safety of all road users.
The iTire portfolio is growing all the time. ContiPressureCheck sensors can also be purchased separately and installed in the tires by customers.

Russian dandelion was cultivated in a way that would enable its long-term per-hectare production in similar quantities to the traditional rubber tree, the \""Hevea brasiliensis\"", from the tropics. Continental has also developed new production methods that allow the natural rubber required for the production of tires and other rubber products to be extracted from the latex sap of the plant."", ""16_p"": ""Initial batches have already seen the production of passenger car winter tires, commercial vehicle tires, and engine mounts using this \""Taraxagum\"" rubber. Tests carried out at the corporation's own test sites prove that the dandelion rubber performs at least as well as traditionally extracted natural rubber in equivalent standard products. The plants can also be cultivated in Northern and Western Europe. Therefore, long transportation routes can be avoided. These routes previously had to cover the distance from the \""rubber belt\"" in the tropics 30 degrees north and south of the equator. This saves valuable resources and reduces CO2 emissions. Continental recently announced the construction of a research facility in Anklam, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, for the production of rubber from the latex sap of the Russian dandelion and plans to invest around €35 million in this new location by 2021."", ""17_p"": ""The institutes and companies involved in the project have already received internationally recognized prizes and awards for the advances they have made.

Continental has won the Innovation and the Green Award both at the international trade fair Automechanika 2016 for its ""Taraxagum – Dandelion Rubber Tires"" project. With these awards, experts at the automotive service industry trade fair recognized the research and development work of the Hanover-based company, which is making long-term plans to produce some of the rubber used in both its tires and other rubber products from the roots of the dandelion plant. By cultivating the Russian dandelion close to the Continental plant, the distances over which the rubber must be transported become much shorter and the resulting CO2 emissions are significantly reduced. In doing this, Continental also hopes to become a little less dependent on developments on the global rubber market.
""We are delighted to receive these accolades,"" says Maria Hanczuch from the Continental Business Development for Passenger and Light Truck Tires business unit, who was in Frankfurt to accept the award. ""Our Taraxagum project demonstrates one aspect of the material development involved in the tires of the future. We are working both on improving our products' technical performance and on making the tire compound and its production process significantly more sustainable.""
Maria Hanczuch and Klaus Engelhart (both Continental) at the ceremony
Continental began work on the development of ""Taraxagum"" in collaboration with the IME Fraunhofer Institute, Münster, the Julius Kühn Institute, Quedlinburg, and plant breeding expert ESKUSA, Parkstetten, around five years ago. Russian dandelion was cultivated in a way that would enable its long-term per-hectare production in similar quantities to the traditional rubber tree, the ""Hevea brasiliensis"", from the tropics. Continental has also developed new production methods that allow the natural rubber required for the production of tires and other rubber products to be extracted from the latex sap of the plant.
Initial batches have already seen the production of passenger car winter tires, commercial vehicle tires, and engine mounts using this ""Taraxagum"" rubber. Tests carried out at the corporation's own test sites prove that the dandelion rubber performs at least as well as traditionally extracted natural rubber in equivalent standard products. The plants can also be cultivated in Northern and Western Europe. Therefore, long transportation routes can be avoided. These routes previously had to cover the distance from the ""rubber belt"" in the tropics 30 degrees north and south of the equator. This saves valuable resources and reduces CO2 emissions. Continental recently announced the construction of a research facility in Anklam, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, for the production of rubber from the latex sap of the Russian dandelion and plans to invest around €35 million in this new location by 2021.
The institutes and companies involved in the project have already received internationally recognized prizes and awards for the advances they have made. In 2014, for example, the project received the ""Green Tec Award"", and in 2015 the research team was awarded the Joseph von Fraunhofer prize from the Fraunhofer Society.

One of these convoys would reduce annual fuel costs by over €9,000 per year and enable the fleet operator to reduce the fleet operator CO2emissions by 24 kg per hour with a convoy of three trucks.
Continental is focusing on an interoperable internet platform, which trucks from different manufacturers and fleet operators can use to form an electronic convoy on the freeway.

Already in April 2016, six truck manufacturers demonstrated the technical functionality of platooning in the European Truck Platooning Challenge and governments around the world are working on the statutory regulations surrounding automated driving. Ruf points out the need for this legislation: ""this legislation is important to create a legal framework that permits the minimum spacing within a platoon to be reduced if the technological capabilities of the trucks allow for it. An opportunity like this, which can bring about huge fuel and, consequently, CO2 savings must not go to waste. We are currently doing We homework with regard to the development of systems for production and striving for swift clarification of the framework conditions. The legal framework is the final hurdle before the introduction of platooning."" Continental will be presenting basic platooning technology at this year's IAA Commercial Vehicles at Stand A06 in Hall 17.
Continental is working on six elements of automated driving both for passenger cars and trucks for production: sensor technology, swarm connectivity, human-machine dialog, system architecture, reliability, and the acceptance of new technology. With regard to the acceptance of innovative technologies by the key players in the transport industry in particular, Continental sees plenty of potential among German and Chinese fleet operators after viewing the initial results of the Continental Mobility Study 2016. Whereas only 15 percent of logisticians surveyed in the latest joint study with infas consider the transport industry to be well positioned for the future, only 28 percent see automated driving as an opportunity for the transport industry. Member of the Continental Executive Board Nikolai Setzer is all too aware of the challenge facing the transport industry, explaining that: ""The initial results of the latest joint study with infas show that the automotive and commercial vehicle industry has got a lot more persuading to do before the obvious advantages of digitalization for safety and environmental protection become a reality on our roads.""
With platooning, the truck, which is electronically coupled with the lead vehicle, consumes up to 15 percent less fuel thanks to safe slipstreaming.

An overview of the various aspects of automation in the automotive and commercial vehicle industries can be found on the information and discussion platform 2025AD.com, which reports on the technology behind platooning and simplifies the concept using infographics. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of automation in the transport industry are also discussed on this platform.
Thanks to the electronic towbar, Continental envisages the possibility to initially reduce the distance between vehicles from 50 meters to only 15 meters at a speed of 80 km/h

The first developments in future connectivity were introduced in to the market in the 1940s. At this time, Motorola integrated the car telephone into the vehicle, providing the basis for 1G mobile technology. About 50 years later, vehicle telematics was introduced. In 1996, the Motorola Automotive Group, now Continental, produced the first modern telematics system known as OnStar. From 2005 on, this technology was deemed to be standard vehicle equipment. For the first time, electronic components were integrated in the vehicle´s human-machine interface and a back-end was developed, which sent vehicle-related data to external servers and enabled remote data access.

In 2007, Continental introduced data-only telematics. This concept, now known as “Machine-to-Machine telematics”, is used as the basis for the vast majority of today´s telematics modules, which are now delivered worldwide. The next milestone followed in 2012, when Continental brought the fifth generation of full-featured telematics platforms to the market supporting the LTE standard for the first time. Today, the latest generation of telematics platforms supports a transmission rate of 150 to 600 Mbits/s (Megabits per second).
To ensure that vehicle telematics remain fit for the future, some essential prerequisites must be met. Modern systems must comply with automotive standards. They must withstand a wide range of temperatures, vibration and uneven road surfaces or humidity.
To be able to place an emergency call safely when required, the units must also be able to withstand accidents. Additionally, high demands are placed on the software. That's why, for its telematics systems, Continental relies on a modular software platform that allows new applications to be integrated quickly. Software updates, which keep not only the telematics system, but also other electronic control units in the vehicle up to date, can also be run over the air. To meet future automated driving requirements, telematics systems will still play an important role in the future.
“The automotive industry has performed exceptionally well in the development of telematics. The business promptly recognized the need and was able to develop pioneering technology. The former car telephone systems were revolutionized and functions like automatic crash recognition made driving safer. Continental set the pace in all development stages, drove the process forward and will continue this path in the future,” summarized Hiebl with reference to the development.

With GM OnStar, one of Continental´s first advanced telematics system rolled off the production line in 1996
To date, over 28 million telematics and connectivity products have been delivered worldwide
Numerous vehicle manufacturers are equipping Numerous vehicle manufacturers vehicles around the world with Continental’s 4G solutions
5G communication standard planned to create new opportunities
Wetzlar (Germany) / Deer Park, September 01, 2016. Over two decades ago, communication and mobility – two basic human needs – were the driving forces behind the development of the first advanced telematics systems for cars. In 1996, the first GM OnStar telematics modules rolled off the production line at the Motorola Automotive Group, which was later acquired by the international technology company Continental. Since then the international technology company Continental has been advancing vehicle connectivity at a global level, delivering over 28 million telematics and connectivity products based on diverse wireless technologies such as cellular, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi for more than 20 years. According to the market research company Gartner, the trend is clear. The IT analysts have forecasted 250 million connected cars on the world's roads by 2020.
""Today's telematics solutions already offer plenty of benefits for automotive manufacturers and drivers, but the possibilities will soon extend beyond functions such as email access or being able to connect with mobile devices,"" said Johann Hiebl, head of the Continental Infotainment & Connectivity business unit. ""In the future, information will be exchanged between vehicles and information surroundings even more quickly than before, making the possibilities almost unlimited. For example, vehicles could be able to communicate directly with the auto repair shop, download vehicle software updates directly via over the air updates, or provide drivers with traffic information before vehicles even start driving.""
Vehicle manufacturers have long recognized the importance of a fast data connection for Vehicle manufacturers vehicles. That is why various automakers around the world have decided to work closely with Continental to further develop connected cars and bring the latest vehicle generations up to 4G standard. Functions such as software updates via over the air interfaces will be essential for the OEMs.
The development of telematics from 1996 until today

To ensure that modern vehicles are ""always on"" and have fast access to external data at all times, modern vehicles need a telematics module that takes on a wide range of functions at the center of modern vehicles communication. Over 35 basic remote vehicle service functions are now covered by these modules, such as the automatic emergency call (for example European eCall), remote diagnostics, and stolen vehicle tracking, as well as connected searching for a parking space and cloud-based navigation. The latest findings from studies indicate a high level of driver interest in these applications. A study by global management consultant firm McKinsey & Company showed that one in three car customers would change the vehicle model in order to have a better connected car. Services that directly support driving, such as connected navigation, are particularly relevant here.[1] In Services that directly support driving, such as connected navigation trend analysis, consultants at the MBtech Group also confirm high demand for connected mobility, combined with a high level of willingness to pay on the part of drivers.[2]
Functions such as the e-call made driving safer

""The results show that we need to continue promoting the development and production of we telematics systems and actively tackle current challenges. That's why we are investing heavily in order to enable fast, stable and secure data transmission to create the connected car and enable automated driving in the future,"" said Hiebl. ""At the moment, we are preparing for the application of 5G technology, which is expected to make communication between all road users significantly faster from 2022 onward. This represents a milestone on the road to the intelligent mobility of the future.""
According to the network providers’ estimates, in the next ten years, the new mobile communication standard could increase data transmission speeds from several hundred megabits (Mbps) per second to several gigabits (Gbps) per second. As a massive step change in bandwidth availability and reduction in latency, 5G is expected to enable true real-time communication between the vehicle and the cloud and thus enhance and realize a magnitude of different functions and automated driving.

Although this benefits the fuel efficiency level this presents a challenge to exhaust gas aftertreatment systems. If the exhaust gas is already at a low temperature at the engine, a long pipe section between the engine and the exhaust gas aftertreatment system, fitted to the chassis between the wheels, is even more disadvantageous as the exhaust gas continues to cool. Particularly in inner-city traffic, Particularly in inner-city traffic can be difficult to ensure an adequate conversion temperature. Installing the DOC close to the engine changes this. With this set-up, heat loss through the flow path can be disregarded. As the efficiency of the the DOC increases with the operating temperature, the volume of the DOC can be reduced. As such, when Continental carried out a test with the DOC near the engine, it was able to reduce the volume of the DOC by 30% from 11.3 to 7.8 liters.
Continental uses the new CS catalyst substrate in Continental solution, where the DOC the DOC is installed near the engine. With this corrugated foil material, the waved structure exhibits a slight slant angle (hence the name Crossversal Structure, “CS”). By combining alternating left and right diagonal waves, the waved structure manages without an intermediate foil for the first time. As a result, the amount of materials used and the weight decrease by 20%. At the same time, the efficiency of the NOx converter increases as the diagonal course of the waves generates turbulence, which brings nitrogen oxide in exhaust gas in better contact with the catalytic-coated surface of the substrate.
Positive Effects of Installation near the Engine
In diesel passenger cars, installing the DOC near the engine is now routine. This trend cannot be implemented so quickly for heavy commercial vehicles in particular, as the underlying chassis has a very long service life. It is for this reason that the first step towards installation close to the engine can only take place using particularly compact catalytic converters.
A close coupled catalyst makes the exhaust gas aftertreatment system in commercial vehicles more effective – thanks to increased efficiency.

Successfully installing the DOC the DOC close to the engine results in additional benefits according to Rolf Brück, Head of Catalysts Product Line, Fuel & Exhaust Management: “For example, the higher temperature level enables earlier release for the injection of the urea solution downstream of the DOC. As a result, NOx conversion starts earlier.” The higher temperature in conjunction with the structured metallic foil materials, on which the urea solution is sprayed, results in the complete evaporation of the urea solution. This prevents the build-up of deposits downstream. the build-up of deposits downstream would restrict cross sections, impair the control quality of the exhaust gas aftertreatment system and destroy gas-conveying components such as flexible elements.
With the long-term and likely complete re-location of the exhaust gas aftertreatment system towards the engine, the volume requirement for parts fitted to the chassis decreases, freeing up space for an increased fuel tank volume. “Installing the exhaust gas aftertreatment system near the engine is a prerequisite. If you don’t start at the front then you won’t have the benefits at the back,” Brück adds."

The plants can also be cultivated in Northern and Western Europe, which makes transportation routes to the European production sites much shorter and contributes to the sustainable and socially viable use of existing resources.
The institutes and companies involved in the project have already received internationally recognized prizes and awards for the advances The institutes and companies involved in the project have made. In 2014, for example, the project received the ""Green Tec Award"", and in 2015 the project was awarded the Joseph von Fraunhofer prize from the Fraunhofer Society.

Hanover, August 3, 2016. The international technology company Continental is raising its earnings forecast for the current fiscal year on the basis of good half-year figures. “We are aiming to achieve an adjusted EBIT margin of over 11 percent for the year as a whole and thus exceed the previously anticipated margin of around 11 percent,” said Dr. Elmar Degenhart, Continental’s chairman of the Executive Board, at the presentation of the business figures for the first six months of the year on Wednesday. The reason for the increase is the Rubber Group’s excellent operating performance: “The very positive unit sales development in our tire business in the first six months has given us an additional boost.” The company’s development is also being helped by the trend in the prices of key raw materials for the production of tires and other rubber products. Over the year as a whole, the price increases are currently expected to be lower overall than forecasted at the end of the first quarter of 2016.

The chairman of the Executive Board gave a positive assessment of the second quarter of 2016: “As expected, our automotive business picked up momentum in the second quarter. With organic growth of around five percent, we grew at a faster rate than the market again in the second quarter. At the same time, we also improved our earnings. Another very pleasing aspect is our order intake, which increased to more than €18 billion lifetime sales in the first half of the year. The Rubber Group continued its positive sales and earnings development. This was thanks in particular to a further rise in sales volumes for tires and further stabilization of industrial business.”
In Degenhart’s view, the half-year results confirm the expectations for the current fiscal year: “Over the remainder of the year, we expect the positive sales momentum to continue in line with our outlook for the fiscal year. However, markets are currently expected to remain volatile due to continuing uncertainty, particularly in light of recent political developments.”

Free cash flow before acquisitions saw a year-on-year increase of €159 million to more than €1 billion. “We were once again able to improve our free cash flow before acquisitions, despite an increase in capital expenditure. We compensated for this primarily with the rise in EBIT and the improvement in working capital,” explained CFO Wolfgang Schäfer. Overall, he sees this as confirmation of the expectations for the year as a whole: “We still expect free cash flow before acquisitions of at least €2 billion for the current fiscal year.”
Free cash flow before acquisitions
The Continental Corporation’s net indebtedness amounted to €3.4 billion at the end of the first half of the year. The main reason for the increase compared to the first quarter of 2016 was the distribution of the dividend for fiscal 2015 in the amount of €750 million in May 2016.
net indebtedness
Compared to the end of 2015, net indebtedness decreased slightly by €96 million. The gearing ratio amounted to 25.8 percent at the end of June 2016 (previous year: 34.1 percent). The equity ratio was around 39 percent.

This is where we have many years of experience as a premium manufacturer,"" said Bublitz. Continental intends to bring a complete tire portfolio for agricultural tractors and harvesting machines to the market, working together with the major vehicle manufacturers in the process. The range will include radial and cross-ply tires in 150 sizes.
The introduction of agricultural radial tires under the brand name Continental in 2017 is marking the end of the trademark license agreement between Continental and its licensee Mitas closed in 2004. After the recent decision of the cartel authorities regarding the acquisition of Mitas, Continental is getting back the brand rights earlier than 2019 as contractually agreed and thus can introduce its agricultural tire portfolio under its premium brand.

The start of production for the Continental branded radial agricultural tires in Lousado is planned for 2017. Continental is already producing cross-ply tires for the agricultural sector in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, and Petaling Jaya, Malaysia.
Besides the investment in the manufacturing plant in Lousado, Continental is additionally investing €2.5 million in a new Research & Development Center in Lousado with the goal to attain a faster product portfolio growth of the agricultural tires. This center will do research in close cooperation with the Central Research & Development department in Hanover, Germany, and at the start will employ five recently recruited engineers. It is foreseen to increase the workforce up to ten highly qualified employees.
Continental also supplies components and systems for agricultural machines and agricultural infrastructure. The range of products extends from comprehensive instrumentation and camera solutions, to sensors, rubber tracks and conveyor belt technology, and exhaust gas treatment. In supplying this combination of components from a single source, Continental is in the position to offer agricultural companies comprehensive solutions for greater efficiency, environmental friendliness, and conservation of resources.
The investment in the radial agricultural tire sector in Lousado is part of Vision 2025, which was launched in 2011 and is used by the Tire division for the strategic planning and systematic implementation of technological progress. Other examples include investments in the AIBA (Automated Indoor Braking Analyzer) in 2012, the ContiLifeCycle Plant for retreading truck tires and rubber recycling in Hanover-Stöcken in 2013, and the High Performance Technology Center in Korbach in 2014.

Thanks to the use of this serially-produced, high-resolution radar with advanced emergency braking in a volume segment, we have made a significant contribution to the improvement of road safety. And for a little extra cost, we can also offer customers additional radar-based comfort functions, such as the automatic distance control ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control).”
A sensor with many advantages
The radar sensor is installed in the front grille right behind the VW badge – and it enables a whole new level of safety. This new, built-in generation of radar differentiates between static and moving objects. Thanks to its wide field of view it not only detects other vehicles, but even pedestrians for the first time. A major advantage is its robustness in adverse weather conditions such as fog, drizzle, or glare from the sun.
As a driver, you can just sit back and let it do its job. The intelligent, radar-based Adaptive Cruise Control makes this possible. Events on the road ahead are continuously monitored and the distance to the vehicle in front is automatically adjusted, without the driver needing to make constant distance corrections. The optional Adaptive Cruise Control enables stress-free and fuel-efficient driving in the VW Tiguan.","VW with clear vision – Continental radar sensor protects pedestrians

Highly skilled employees hand stitch these special tires for the world's most famous bike race. But of course, these special tires for the world's most famous bike race can also be found adorning the wheels of amateur cyclists. Still on the subject of two-wheelers, Korbach also delivers reliable grip for motorbikes as well, always assuming motorbikes tires bear the name Continental on the sidewall. High load-bearing capacity and indestructibility are the hallmarks of the industrial tires – for forklift trucks, for example – which are also made in Korbach. And there are the ContiTech production shops that make hoses for carrying liquids and gases in both automotive and industrial applications. Without the products from Continental, Europe's largest rubber specialist, many vehicles would probably never get off the production line.
What is most striking about the tires manufactured in Korbach is the range of different products – Continental's plant produces virtually any kind of tire for just about anything on wheels. From compact cars to heavy forklifts, from super sports cars and SUVs to mountain bikes and folding bicycles – tires from Korbach deliver maximum grip, safety and fun. And not just for the domestic market. Our employees' reputation for craftsmanship means that this corner of Germany also produces high performance tires that are strictly prohibited on the country’s own roads.
Tires with special ""bonded"" studs are one of Korbach's specialties. Away from prying eyes, a studding machine inserts the studs using a specially developed process to ensure maximum strength and durability. Winter tires with the ""Made in Korbach"" label are developed and built with such expertise that even the highly critical Scandinavian trade press is regularly thrilled with even the highly critical Scandinavian trade press performance. As the Continental Corporation’s center of excellence for winter tire production, Korbach remains the pilot plant when scaling up new processes and components for building winter tires. To ensure the safety of Europe's drivers in winter too, the pilot plant turns the seasons on Europe's drivers heads: With the sun beating down on the production shops at the height of summer and the employees are sweating beside the employees 120°C curing presses, the employees are already well into the winter season, producing winter tires for central Europe and studded winter tires for Nordic roads.
The High Performance Technology Center (HPTC) is the new kid on the block in Korbach. The High Performance Technology Center (HPTC) produces short runs of test tires and high-tech tires for luxury-class super sports cars, and tries out new production processes. Continental has invested €45 million in this facility, officially opened in June 2016, creating a total of 80 new jobs. And having built the world's most advanced tire production plant, Continental will now be carrying out some R&D work – traditionally the preserve of Hanover – in Korbach too.
A thoroughbred Continental motorcycle racing tire is used in various classes in Germany's Seriensport races for street-legal machines. Again, Korbach is behind Continental motorcycle racing tire and also developed Continental motorcycle racing tire at the plant, where the two-wheeler specialists have the two-wheeler specialists own R&D department right next door. Continental’s two-wheeler tires are also in demand in both the original equipment and replacement markets, delivering maximum grip and safety.
Korbach is also home to ContiTech Schlauch which produces under-the-hood and underbody hoses. In the absence of these hoses and manifolds, neither fuel, nor brake fluid nor exhaust gas could move around the car and engine. To do their job, these flexible lines have to be extremely resistant to heat and pressure. Even the quantities involved are amazing – the plant produces over 185,000 meters of hose per day, enough to reach from the factory gates all the way to Cologne. In addition, hoses are produced for the food processing industry, aircraft refuelling and horticulture. Other products include hose bends and parts for connecting the various lines and hoses in cars.
For Korbach's 24,000 or so inhabitants, the plant is the largest employer and, with apprentice numbers currently standing at 146, one of the region's largest training organizations, as well."

Hanover, 7 June 2016. As an official sponsor of UEFA EURO 2016TM, Continental is equipping Team and transfer buses that will take the competing teams to the ten host cities all over France with premium bus tyres. In addition to the buses used by the 24 teams who have qualified, the 20 VIP buses provided by specifically selected private transport companies will also run on the specially designed Conti Goal HA3. This exclusive UEFA EURO 2016TM tyre, which is based on the tried-and-tested Conti CityPlus HA3 tyre for regional transportation, was developed by the Continental engineers in Hanover, Germany, especially for this occasion. In size 295/80 R 22.5, Conti Goal HA3 can be fitted to any axle. The tread features well-defined longitudinal grooves for optimum handling and wet performance. The combination with deep 3D sipes offers extra grip and consistently reliable braking characteristics throughout the tyre's service life. Together with the special rubber tread compound, the closed side flanks ensure exceptionally pleasant low-noise rolling properties. The stronger side wall structure reduces the flexing energy of the tyre, thereby helping significantly to reduce fuel consumption.

According to Frank Jourdan, member of the Executive Board of Continental AG responsible for the Chassis & Safety Division: “Autonomous emergency braking or AEB systems are an important step on the way to accident-free driving – our Vision Zero. Due to the importance of AEB for road safety, it is already mandatory for heavy commercial vehicles in Japan and Europe. In the passenger car segment, the introduction of these systems is being driven forward powerfully by NCAP organizations. In my view, it won't be long before we're seeing these systems as standard equipment.”

Nikolai Setzer, member of the Executive Board of Continental AG responsible for the Tire Division, said, “This UN resolution is a great tailwind for our joint “Stop the Crash” campaign. It underlines that the campaign is focusing on exactly the right life-saving technologies. We will of course also be doing our best to demonstrate the high relevance of tire quality and maintenance, over and above ESC, AEB and motorcycle ABS.”
Together with partners like Continental, in its “Stop the Crash” campaign Global NCAP is staging driving demonstrations to inform people about the benefits of the safety technologies that are already available in series production, the aim being to encourage the spread of these technologies in compact and subcompact cars. Given the high number of new registrations in these segments, the regional focus is on highly populated newly industrialized countries. The ESC, AEB and motorcycle ABS technologies are highlighted on the automotive side, while on the tire side the focus is on raising awareness of maintaining correct tire pressures and sufficient tread depth. Continental expects the two driving demonstrations staged each year by the “Stop the Crash” initiative in countries such as Chile, Mexico, Malaysia, China or India, to boost awareness of the contribution that advanced safety systems and tires make to greater safety. The ultimate aim is to achieve a tangible increase in road safety around the world and a progressive drop in the number of road fatalities, injuries and accidents.
Global NCAP's “Stop the Crash” campaign was officially launched on 18 November 2015 in Brasilia, Brazil.

Based on the Brasilia Declaration, the active accident prevention systems ESC, AEB and motorcycle ABS are explicitly recommended as standard equipment
The UN goal of halving the number of road deaths worldwide between 2010 and 2020 will not be achieved without additional safety efforts
“Stop the Crash” information campaign highlights the contribution of ESC, AEB and motorcycle ABS and raises awareness of tire tread depth and tire pressure
Automotive supplier and tire manufacturer Continental expressly welcomes the UN resolution recommending installation of the most important active accident prevention systems as standard equipment in new cars in all member states. the UN resolution is based on the Brasilia Declaration which was adopted by the 2nd Global High-Level Conference on Road Safety. the Brasilia Declaration which was adopted by the 2nd Global High-Level Conference on Road Safety advocates equipping new vehicles with active safety systems as standard, which is also the main focus of the “Stop the Crash” partnership. The emphasis in these active safety systems is on vehicle technologies that actively intervene in the driving process and thus help to mitigate critical situations as well as prevent accidents. Electronic stability control (ESC) is the most important advance in vehicle safety since the introduction of seatbelts. In many situations, ESC can prevent vehicles from skidding and ESC provides the basis for other safety technologies including proactive driver assistance systems such as autonomous emergency braking (AEB). These are state-of-the-art systems that can help drivers avoid or mitigate collisions with other vehicles or road users. Antilock braking systems (ABS) for motorcycles prevent the wheels from locking up and ensure both the stability of the motorcycle as well as optimal deceleration under braking.
Frank Jourdan, Member of the Executive Board of Continental AG and President of the Chassis & Safety Division
The Chairman of the “Stop the Crash” partnership, David Ward from Global NCAP, said, “The new UN resolution is a significant step forward in vehicle and road safety. The Stop the Crash Partnership was created to promote active safety systems with a proven track record in crash avoidance. The recognition and endorsement of this approach by UN will help accelerate the adoption of the legislation required by governments across the globe to mandate these life-saving technologies.”
