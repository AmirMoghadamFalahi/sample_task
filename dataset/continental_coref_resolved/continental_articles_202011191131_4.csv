© Continental AG ​​​​​​​ If only 50 percent of the annual mileage of a truck – totaling 150,000 km – was driven in convoy, every coupled truck would be able to save 4,000 liters of diesel per year. One of these convoys would reduce annual fuel costs by over €9,000 per year and enable the fleet operator to reduce the fleet operator CO2emissions by 24 kg per hour with a convoy of three trucks. Continental is focusing on an interoperable internet platform, which trucks from different manufacturers and fleet operators can use to form an electronic convoy on the freeway. 

© Continental AG Already in April 2016, six truck manufacturers demonstrated the technical functionality of platooning in the European Truck Platooning Challenge and governments around the world are working on the statutory regulations surrounding automated driving. Ruf points out the need for this legislation: ""this legislation is important to create a legal framework that permits the minimum spacing within a platoon to be reduced if the technological capabilities of the trucks allow for it. An opportunity like this, which can bring about huge fuel and, consequently, CO2 savings must not go to waste. We are currently doing We homework with regard to the development of systems for production and striving for swift clarification of the framework conditions. The legal framework is the final hurdle before the introduction of platooning."" Continental will be presenting basic platooning technology at this year's IAA Commercial Vehicles at Stand A06 in Hall 17. Continental is working on six elements of automated driving both for passenger cars and trucks for production: sensor technology, swarm connectivity, human-machine dialog, system architecture, reliability, and the acceptance of new technology. With regard to the acceptance of innovative technologies by the key players in the transport industry in particular, Continental sees plenty of potential among German and Chinese fleet operators after viewing the initial results of the Continental Mobility Study 2016. Whereas only 15 percent of logisticians surveyed in the latest joint study with infas consider the transport industry to be well positioned for the future, only 28 percent see automated driving as an opportunity for the transport industry.

This concept, now known as “Machine-to-Machine telematics”, is used as the basis for the vast majority of today´s telematics modules, which are now delivered worldwide. The next milestone followed in 2012, when Continental brought the fifth generation of full-featured telematics platforms to the market supporting the LTE standard for the first time. Today, the latest generation of telematics platforms supports a transmission rate of 150 to 600 Mbits/s (Megabits per second). To ensure that vehicle telematics remain fit for the future, some essential prerequisites must be met. Modern systems must comply with automotive standards. They must withstand a wide range of temperatures, vibration and uneven road surfaces or humidity. To be able to place an emergency call safely when required, the units must also be able to withstand accidents. Additionally, high demands are placed on the software. That's why, for its telematics systems, Continental relies on a modular software platform that allows new applications to be integrated quickly. Software updates, which keep not only the telematics system, but also other electronic control units in the vehicle up to date, can also be run over the air. To meet future automated driving requirements, telematics systems will still play an important role in the future. “The automotive industry has performed exceptionally well in the development of telematics. The business promptly recognized the need and was able to develop pioneering technology. The former car telephone systems were revolutionized and functions like automatic crash recognition made driving safer. Continental set the pace in all development stages, drove the process forward and will continue this path in the future,” summarized Hiebl with reference to the development.

Over two decades ago, communication and mobility – two basic human needs – were the driving forces behind the development of the first advanced telematics systems for cars. In 1996, the first GM OnStar telematics modules rolled off the production line at the Motorola Automotive Group, which was later acquired by the international technology company Continental. Since then the international technology company Continental has been advancing vehicle connectivity at a global level, delivering over 28 million telematics and connectivity products based on diverse wireless technologies such as cellular, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi for more than 20 years. According to the market research company Gartner, the trend is clear. The IT analysts have forecasted 250 million connected cars on the world's roads by 2020. ""Today's telematics solutions already offer plenty of benefits for automotive manufacturers and drivers, but the possibilities will soon extend beyond functions such as email access or being able to connect with mobile devices,"" said Johann Hiebl, head of the Continental Infotainment & Connectivity business unit. ""In the future, information will be exchanged between vehicles and information surroundings even more quickly than before, making the possibilities almost unlimited. For example, vehicles could be able to communicate directly with the auto repair shop, download vehicle software updates directly via over the air updates, or provide drivers with traffic information before vehicles even start driving."" Vehicle manufacturers have long recognized the importance of a fast data connection for Vehicle manufacturers vehicles. That is why various automakers around the world have decided to work closely with Continental to further develop connected cars and bring the latest vehicle generations up to 4G standard. Functions such as software updates via over the air interfaces will be essential for the OEMs. The development of telematics from 1996 until today 

© Continental AG To ensure that modern vehicles are ""always on"" and have fast access to external data at all times, modern vehicles need a telematics module that takes on a wide range of functions at the center of modern vehicles communication. Over 35 basic remote vehicle service functions are now covered by these modules, such as the automatic emergency call (for example European eCall), remote diagnostics, and stolen vehicle tracking, as well as connected searching for a parking space and cloud-based navigation.

Successfully installing the DOC the DOC close to the engine results in additional benefits according to Rolf Brück, Head of Catalysts Product Line, Fuel & Exhaust Management: “For example, the higher temperature level enables earlier release for the injection of the urea solution downstream of the DOC. As a result, NOx conversion starts earlier.” The higher temperature in conjunction with the structured metallic foil materials, on which the urea solution is sprayed, results in the complete evaporation of the urea solution. This prevents the build-up of deposits downstream. the build-up of deposits downstream would restrict cross sections, impair the control quality of the exhaust gas aftertreatment system and destroy gas-conveying components such as flexible elements.With the long-term and likely complete re-location of the exhaust gas aftertreatment system towards the engine, the volume requirement for parts fitted to the chassis decreases, freeing up space for an increased fuel tank volume. “Installing the exhaust gas aftertreatment system near the engine is a prerequisite. If you don’t start at the front then you won’t have the benefits at the back,” Brück adds. the engine is designed for lowest fuel efficiency at high loads. However, in other operating situations, engines hardly release any heat. Although this benefits the fuel efficiency level this presents a challenge to exhaust gas aftertreatment systems. If the exhaust gas is already at a low temperature at the engine, a long pipe section between the engine and the exhaust gas aftertreatment system, fitted to the chassis between the wheels, is even more disadvantageous as the exhaust gas continues to cool. Particularly in inner-city traffic, Particularly in inner-city traffic can be difficult to ensure an adequate conversion temperature. Installing the DOC close to the engine changes this. With this set-up, heat loss through the flow path can be disregarded. As the efficiency of the the DOC increases with the operating temperature, the volume of the DOC can be reduced. As such, when Continental carried out a test with the DOC near the engine, it was able to reduce the volume of the DOC by 30% from 11.3 to 7.8 liters. Continental uses the new CS catalyst substrate in Continental solution, where the DOC the DOC is installed near the engine. With this corrugated foil material, the waved structure exhibits a slight slant angle (hence the name Crossversal Structure, “CS”). By combining alternating left and right diagonal waves, the waved structure manages without an intermediate foil for the first time. As a result, the amount of materials used and the weight decrease by 20%. At the same time, the efficiency of the NOx converter increases as the diagonal course of the waves generates turbulence, which brings nitrogen oxide in exhaust gas in better contact with the catalytic-coated surface of the substrate. Positive Effects of Installation near the engine In diesel passenger cars, installing the DOC near the engine is now routine. This trend cannot be implemented so quickly for heavy commercial vehicles in particular, as the underlying chassis has a very long service life. It is for this reason that the first step towards installation close to the engine can only take place using particularly compact catalytic converters. A close coupled catalyst makes the exhaust gas aftertreatment system in commercial vehicles more effective – thanks to increased efficiency.

""In the last five years, our have invested more than €3 billion in building new plants and expanding the capacity of our existing plants worldwide. What's more, our unique Automated Indoor Braking Analyzer (AIBA) at our Contidrom proving ground and the High Performance Technology Center (HPTC) in Korbach, which opened in June, are demonstrating the continuous further intensification of our technological focus. With the new research facility in Anklam (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania) our want to show that our are also adopting innovative and sustainable approaches in the field of raw materials. After careful consideration, our chose Anklam (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania) as the location for our new facility based on the conditions and opportunities it offered and our would like to thank the people of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania as well as Anklams Regional-Investment Corporation for the people of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania as well as Anklams Regional-Investment Corporation professional support."" On Friday the Minister for Economic Affairs in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Harry Glawe, said: „I`m more than happy that a global player like Continental has taken the location decision in favour of our federal state and will establish in the region of Western Pomerania. Now the investment focus will be put on research and development in the first step. By doing so the foundation for further growth and additional jobs in the region of Western Pomerania is build. The goal of this project is to achieve a sustainable usage of dandelion as a local and regional raw material basis. Mid-term the next milestone will be the commercialization of cultivation and use of the raw materials created out of Russian dandelion locally. This industrial location proves that Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania continues to developing towards a highly requested region and attractive business location.“ f.l.t.r.: Mayor of Anklam M.

Köller (Continental) Dr. Andreas Topp, Head of Material and Process Development and Industrialization for Tires at Continental ""With the Taraxagum Lab Anklam we have now reached a milestone in the 'Taraxagum – tires from dandelion rubber' project"", explains Dr. Andreas Topp, head of material and process development as well as industrialization for Tires at Continental. ""This exciting project has already developed at a promising rate. A small series of Taraxagum test tires with tread made from pure dandelion rubber was tested against conventional tires made from natural rubber from the hevea brasiliensis rubber tree and the results were extremely positive. Now we want to drive forward the economical production of Taraxagum, and with the new research facility in Anklam we are laying the foundations for this."" Continental began work on the development of ""Taraxagum"" in collaboration with the IME Fraunhofer Institute, Münster, the Julius Kühn Institute, Quedlinburg, and plant breeding company ESKUSA, Parkstetten, around five years ago. Russian dandelion was cultivated in such a way that Russian dandelion could be produced in greater quantities than the traditional rubber trees from the tropics. New process and production methods were also developed in order to produce the natural rubber used in the production of tires and other rubber products from the latex sap of the plant roots. In the first experiments, Continental produced passenger car winter tires and engine mounts from the ""Taraxagum"" rubber. The plants can also be cultivated in Northern and Western Europe, which makes transportation routes to the European production sites much shorter and contributes to the sustainable and socially viable use of existing resources. The institutes and companies involved in the project have already received internationally recognized prizes and awards for the advances The institutes and companies involved in the project have made. In 2014, for example, the project received the ""Green Tec Award"", and in 2015 the project was awarded the Joseph von Fraunhofer prize from the Fraunhofer Society.

In addition, we are very happy to cooperate with CATARC so that the test center Yancheng will also bring the most advanced safety technologies to China. It is we goal to meet local market demands, as well as help to enhance China’s road safety consciousness and support the realization of ‘Vision Zero.’” As a technical administration body in the auto industry – established in 1985 – and a technical support organization to China governmental authorities, CATARC followsthe rule “Independent, Justice, Third Party” to conduct various activities like auto standard and technical regulation formulating, product certification testing and quality system certification. In January, Continental and CATARC signed the strategic cooperation agreement to strengthen the bilateral relationship based on the long term cooperation. Li Zanfeng, General Manager of CATARC Test Proving Gound Yancheng, expressed: “Continental is one of our important partners, whom our have cooperated with in different areas for many years. Undoubtedly, the joint investment on the test center Yancheng is another milestone of the strategic cooperation which will enhance the cooperation in the area of automotive safety.” The “Continental Chassis & Safety Technology Summit 2016” focused on issues related to safety on Chinese roads On the same day as the opening of the test center Yancheng, the Continental Chassis & Safety Technology Summit 2016 was successfully held in Yancheng. With the theme ""SensePlanAct"", The “Continental Chassis & Safety Technology Summit 2016” underlined Continental’s attention to China’s road-safety issues. The Chassis & Safety division, one of Continental’s five strong divisions, has long been putting constant efforts in the pursuit of “Vision Zero"" – a future without road accidents. Integrating various active and passive safety systems and improving the safety and dynamics of vehicles, the division is committed to creating safer and more comfortable driving experiences for the division customers. To realize this goal, the theme ""SensePlanAct"" clearly defines the importance that driving safety products have played in driving and also guides the R&D Process. The “Continental Chassis & Safety Technology Summit 2016” focuses on technologies solutions along the driving chain of effects (“SensePlanAct”) that form the foundation for automated driving. Continental has started automated driving initiatives in the U.S, Germany and Japan, and the plan for China is on the way this August. Workshops as well as test driving opportunities improve participants’ understanding of development of these technologies and communicate participants insights of the industry. Key product topics of the workshop are the leading technologies under the driving chain “SensePlanAct” such as ADAS (Sense), the Safety Domain Control Unit (Plan) and the integrated brake system MK C1 (Act). Head of Chassis & Safety Division China, Enno Tang said: “Continental has always been adhering to the strategy of ‘In China, For China’ to prioritize the localization of technology innovation and development. Following this development principle, Continental reiterates Continental commitment to road safety in China by underlining the importance of safety technologies to automotive manufacturers and end consumers in this market.” A powerful tornado hit some areas of YanCheng city, Jiang Su province on June 23rd.. The tornado damaged homes, streets and also the local economy has been affected. China decided therefore to reduce the cost of the opening ceremony and donate the savings of 100,000 RMB to the benefits of the children and students in the disaster hit areas. Especially for the local affected schools Continental would like to ensure that the students will be able to study in the upcoming new semester in September. The automotive supplier will therefore cooperate closely with local organizations and initiate The automotive supplier accordingly."

The competition is high, and every year the outcome is eagerly anticipated: Which company from among the 800 or so strategic suppliers of technology company Continental will be named supplier of the year in the automotive business? Recently at the Supplier Day 2016, which was held at Dresden’s Ostrapark exhibition center, a total of 13 companies were honored for their fantastic achievements based on a comprehensive, systematic assessment process. The event was held under the motto “2016 – The Year of Supplier Quality.” In front of around 400 guests from all over the world, Dr. Elmar Degenhart, Continental’s chairman of the Executive Board, said in his speech: “The demands our customers place on us are rising all the time. As a result our solutions for this are becoming more complex. After all, electrification of the powertrain, automation of driving functions and advanced digitalization, as well as new business models for advanced mobility services require superior quality, close connectivity, and increasing cross-industry collaboration. Many customers also rely on platform concepts. Consequently, the entire supply chain is feeling the effects of these increased, and in some cases new requirements when it comes to quality and reliability. This is why we involve our suppliers in our solutions development and quality assurance processes as extensively and as early as possible. For this reason, at Continental, quality management for suppliers was recently assigned to the purchasing department, which works particularly closely with our suppliers. At the end of the day, only by working together we can achieve technology leadership and superior competitiveness.” For its automotive business, Continental procures 135 billion individual components a year from a total of 4,000 suppliers at some 100 production locations worldwide. Günter Fella, Head of Purchasing, said: “Every quality issue is also a logistical disruption, which can quickly turn into a supply bottleneck – since our products have an average material proportion of 50 percent. With our special inspection procedures, which supplement the traditional approvals process, we enable our suppliers to manufacture and supply their components to precisely match our requirements.” Supplier of the Year: award based on a comprehensive assessment system The Supplier of the Year Awards have been presented since 2008 by the three Continental divisions, Chassis & Safety, Powertrain, and Interior. These awards are now renowned across the entire industry. They are based on a complex evaluation process, whereby Continental assesses its strategic suppliers in the automotive business all year round against a list of defined criteria. It includes the categories Quality, Technology, Logistics, Costs, and Purchasing Conditions. Awards are presented in the six fields of Electronics, Electromechanics, Mechanics & Raw Material, Plastics & Rubber, and Investment & Engineering Services in addition to division-specific categories. For the last six years already, along with these regular award categories, there has also been a special Quality Award that honors exceptional performance in terms of quality improvement and supports Continental’s high expectations when it comes to quality.

It is true that connectivity solutions are playing an increasingly important role in the supply chain and in the transportation industry because they increase efficiencies and help cut costs in an increasingly competitive market. “However, connectivity also increases the risks of cyberattacks on transportation companies. At the same time, smaller companies in particular are still hesitant to invest in protecting themselves and their vehicle fleets from attacks,” explains Dr. Mathias Dehm, Head of Research and Processes for Product Security at Continental. Solutions that are more closely tailored to their needs and budgets and the recent regulation of the field of vehicle cybersecurity can greatly improve their cybersecurity posture.

Following the global launch of Stop the Crash at the the 2nd Global High Level Conference on Road Safety in Brasilia in November 2015, the Stop the Crash Partnership has been holding a series of events across the globe promoting the importance of active safety systems.  Today’s Latin American launch specifically focused on the implementation of Stop the the Crash technologies in the region and took place with support from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) and the Chilean Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications, featuring demonstrations of electronic stability control (ESC), autonomous emergency braking (AEB), anti-lock braking system (ABS) for motorcycles, and tyre safety. The campaign recently hit a significant milestone in April with the adoption of a United Nations (UN) Resolution which specifically invited member states to adopt active safety systems as standard. Following the vehicle demonstrations at Stop the Crash technologies in the region, Global New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP) in partnership with ECLAC hosted a Regional High Level Road Safety Seminar on Vehicle Safety which featured representatives from ECLAC, Automobile Club of Chile (ACCHI), and the FIA Foundation. David Ward, Global NCAP Secretary General and Stop the Crash Partnership Chairman said: “Technologies such as ESC have the potential to save thousands of lives every year in Latin America.

Continental’s Nuremberg site is celebrating its silver jubilee. Based in Sieboldstrasse, this site has been developing and producing electronic systems for the auto industry for the past quarter of a century. It was founded in 1993 by TEMIC Telefunken microelectronics GmbH, and became the TEMIC headquarters in 1998, before being fully taken over by Continental in 2001. For the Continental corporation, Nuremberg is also an important hub: This site is the international automotive supplier’s global competence center for the development and production of electronic transmission controllers and hybrid and electric drive systems. And as the headquarters of Continental’s Transmission and Hybrid Electric Vehicle business units it also plays a significant role at the business level. 48-volt belt starter generator with integrated power electronics – produced in Nuremberg 

© Continental AG In both electric mobility and automated driving – two of the megatrends affecting the automotive industry – Continental Nuremberg leads the way with its innovative products. The automotive supplier is one of the world‘s leading manufacturers of electronic transmission controllers, which are a key component of autonomous vehicles. And at the same time, it has long been a driving force in the field of electric mobility, with a broad product portfolio that extends all the way to complete powertrains for electric vehicles. One half of Continental Nuremberg’s workforce of almost 3,000 works on the development side, while the other half are employed in production roles. Most of the high-tech electronic and mechatronic products built here are produced under clean-room conditions. At the same time, the site’s transition to Industry 4.0 is well underway, with collaborative robots (cobots) already in use on Nuremberg’s increasingly automated and digitalized production lines, where they work closely with their human coworkers. “Digitalization offers huge opportunities to increase our competitiveness” “We enjoy a big advantage here in Nuremberg in having all our operations – from development and production to central functions such as quality management and purchasing – under one roof,” says Claus Helmers, who took over as Location and Plant Manager at Continental Nuremberg in April 2018. “But of course, our biggest asset are our dedicated, high-quality employees. I’ve not been here long, but in that short time I have been struck many times and in many different situations by the highly motivated mindset of a workforce that is committed in every way to the success of this site.” The 54-year-old mechanical engineer previously headed one of the three focus factories at the company’s electronics plant in Regensburg, which is Continental’s largest Automotive plant. Helmers has worked in the automotive electronics industry for almost thirty years. During that time, he has held a variety of management positions in production, development and sales, initially at Siemens Bordnetze and from 1998 at Siemens VDO, which was taken over by Continental in 2007. As well as promoting a culture of openness and trust, Helmers’ priorities in his new role as Plant Manager in Nuremberg will also include coaching, team spirit and talent development. “Frank and open communication across all hierarchical levels, and a focus on mutual respect at all times, can give us a head start in achieving our goals and resolving problems quickly and effectively,” says Helmers. “Transparency and an emphasis on individual responsibility also helps to inspire employees to contribute new ideas and, by taking an active role in decision-making, to grow in confidence, while also fostering a sense of common purpose and strengthening collaboration both within and across departmental boundaries.” The new Plant Manager will also be driving forward digitalization which, he says “offers us huge opportunities to increase our competitiveness on the international stage.” Digitalization is not just about manufacturing, he adds, but also covers all the other areas too, including development and administration. “Digitalization starts in the office and continues right through to the product,” says Helmers. A further top priority for the site is close partnership with local universities, where Helmers notes that: “We will continue to seize the opportunities offered by our physical proximity to the research centers, extending our partnerships on this front to work jointly with the universities on new technologies.” 50 apprentices, first dual-study courses in 2019, flexible working conditions Looking to the future, Helmers can see that the Continental Nuremberg plant will have a growing need for skilled personnel. To meet this demand, the location will be cooperating with a number of universities to offer the first dual-study courses starting in 2019. “By training the next generation of skilled professionals ourselves, we can help to build a stronger future for the plant,” says Helmers. Currently, 50 young men and women are taking part in conventional apprenticeships (m/f/x) at the site, covering a wide range of occupations including industrial management assistant, tool engineer, mechatronics technician, computer science expert, process technician for plastics and rubber engineering, electronics technician for equipment and systems and automotive software developer (almost one quarter of the apprentices currently undergoing training at Continental Nuremberg are enrolled in this discipline). In future the site will also offer three Continental bachelor dual-study courses (m/f/x) in business management (incorporating an industrial management assistant apprenticeship), electrical engineering and information technology (incorporating an electronics technician apprenticeship) and mechatronics/precision engineering (incorporating a mechatronics technician apprenticeship).

Continental Continental released Continental 2018 half-year results today in Hanover. Continental accelerated Continental growth in the second quarter of 2018 and once again grew faster than Continental relevant markets. After six months, organic sales growth amounted to 5.4 percent, with all five divisions making a contribution. In the same period, the Automotive business was up 6.6 percent in organic terms. the Automotive business was thus able to grow nearly 5 percentage points faster than the global production of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, which was up by about 2 percent. For the current year, Continental still expects the global production of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles to rise by more than 1 percent. In the first half of the year, Continental upped Continental sales to €22.4 billion and posted an adjusted operating result of €2.2 billion. This corresponds to an adjusted EBIT margin of 10 percent. “Our technological strength underpins our rapid and profitable growth. Our technological strength makes mobility around the world safe, clean and intelligent. Our technological strength is pioneering for the mobility of the future and vital for our long-term success in an environment characterized by change and uncertainty,” said Continental CEO Dr. Elmar Degenhart on Thursday while presenting the business figures for the first half of 2018. Continental CEO Dr. Elmar Degenhart added: “Our profitable growth in the second quarter is further proof of Our strength. In addition, the high order intake in the field of electric mobility is also quite gratifying and demonstrates that our product portfolio is fit for the future.” In the first half of the year, more than €1 billion in orders were received for products and systems for hybrid and electric cars. At over €20 billion, order intake continues to be at a record level in the entire automotive sector after six months. Continental during the first half of the year the year grew faster than Continental relevant markets 

© Continental AG Sales growth was up in particular in the Powertrain division in the second quarter. “Our future alignment is paving the way for Powertrain as well as the other divisions to continue to outpace our relevant markets in the future as well, as part of our values alliance for top value creation,” he said, making reference to the recently announced realignment of Continental. Degenhart was also pleased with the quarterly results of the Tire division, which had been impacted by exchange-rate effects in the first three months. Degenhart adjusted EBIT rose from 15.2 percent in the first quarter to 17.8 percent in the second quarter. “Our tire business was back up again in the second quarter, maintaining Our tire business profitable position on the global market,” said Degenhart, summing up the positive development. “As expected, all five divisions posted good organic growth. In light of this, Our are satisfied with Our sales development in the first half of the year,” said CFO Wolfgang Schaefer, commenting on the past half-year. With regards to the results, CFO Wolfgang Schaefer, commenting on the past half-year added: “The industry is currently undergoing radical technological change. The industry is all about automation, connectivity and electrification. Looking at our results, the trend reflects the substantial investments our have made in the development of these future technologies. The increase in order intake has in recent years also resulted in start-up costs.” In the last half-year, the technology company spent €2.9 billion on investments as well as on research and development. According to Schaefer, there are only a few companies worldwide that are pushing developments in the field of mobility to this extent. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, Schaefer pointed out that the third quarter is traditionally impacted by seasonal effects: “Carmakers close down plants for vacation in the third quarter. Furthermore, next quarter will probably be negatively impacted by the new test procedure WLTP.” At present, Continental is expecting a strong quarter at the end of the year, and is therefore confirming Continental outlook for the full business year.

Continental was the issuer of the money market security, which was in the form of a euro-denominated electronic commercial paper according to legal requirements stipulated in the Luxembourg law.

The companies not only generated the money market security, but also processed the trade (including payment processing) in a legally binding manner using blockchain.

Blockchain will change aspects such as transparency, direct contact with investors and prompt settlement of transactions. The latter will change particularly with regard to the very short terms typically seen for money market securities. Payment and payment processing normally take two days. This is because of clearing systems, which are used to settle payments between accounts and involve a certain time lag. Blockchain is a special form of distributed ledger technology (DLT). It involves a local database that is used to store replicated, shared and synchronized digital data. All users of a DLT network have access to the same data at the same time. They also have shared write and read rights to the data and shared transparency. This causes a shift in the role of central broker – which is usually performed by banks in the context of financial transactions. State-of-the-art encryption and signature processes based on asymmetric cryptography are used, and are now considered to be practically tamper-proof. For the first time a digital money market security transaction was processed in a legally binding manner. This also made the transaction a lot faster and more efficient to process than before. It was possible because unlike similar blockchain transactions that have been processed previously, this transaction involved a security displayed entirely in blockchain form. The money market security was issued purely in digital form, with the purchase price amount in euros converted by Commerzbank – which has an e-money license – into digital money, so that payment could be made using blockchain. All requirements relating to this transaction were handled by digital and legally binding means using blockchain technology. Immediate value dating and real-time settlement were also possible. This is being regarded as the first step toward technical scaling of automated securities issues. In the pilot transaction, the security was issued in accordance with Luxembourg law. Consequently, the security was issued, signed and traded digitally using a qualified electronic signature. In addition, for the security trade to be displayed directly and digitally as a delivery vs. payment transaction, the e-money held as financial collateral by Commerzbank was furnished digitally via blockchain, enabling the companies to exchange the security instantly for e-money.","Continental, Commerzbank and Siemens Successfully Field-Tested Blockchain Technology on Money Market Commercial paper transaction processed in minutes rather than days thanks to blockchain technology Project is a major step toward fully blockchain-based securities trading Hanover, Frankfurt, Munich, February 21, 2019. For the first time, Continental, Commerzbank and Siemens have carried out a test transaction as part of a pilot project to process a money market security between the companies using blockchain technology. a test transaction took place in January. a test transaction had a volume of €100,000 and a term of three days. Continental was the issuer of the money market security, which was in the form of a euro-denominated electronic commercial paper according to legal requirements stipulated in the Luxembourg law. Commerzbank provided the Corda-based blockchain platform through Commerzbank research and development unit, Main Incubator, and acted as a service partner. Siemens subscribed to the money market security as an investor. Corporate law firm GSK Stockmann provided legal advice on a test transaction. The main motivating factor for Continental, Commerzbank and Siemens Siemens to carry out this project was to experiment with blockchain technology in practice with a view to using this project in the medium to long term for regular financial transactions as well. In this project, a test transaction was initiated and settled directly between the companies using blockchain technology. A regular securities transaction between two companies was used as a starting point. the companies using blockchain technology not only generated the money market security, but also processed the trade (including payment processing) in a legally binding manner using blockchain. The documents and funds were exchanged in a matter of minutes rather than days using this process. Unlike with conventional transactions, Commerzbank was no longer acting as a broker between contracting parties for a test transaction, but as a platform operator and service partner. Commerzbank provided the platform and all the technical requirements for blockchain trading, the legal structure and the digital money for direct trading of the money market security (based on e-money as financial collateral, “cash on ledger”). Stefan Scholz, Head of Finance & Treasury 

© Continental AG Stefan Scholz, head of Finance & Treasury at Continental, was pleased with the successful outcome of this project, and commented, “Blockchain made this process even quicker and more effective. Working with “ project partners, Siemens and Commerzbank, we tested the feasibility of using blockchain in the Finance department and the feasibility of using blockchain in the Finance department proved to be a success. I’m proud of this pioneering achievement. We gained some new experience across various areas of We companies in both a technical and legal respect and also in terms of interlinking between the specialist departments.” Direct contact (including with investors in short-term bonds), considerable flexibility and efficiency combined with increased security, as well as enhanced transparency, are some of the advantages that Continental sees in using blockchain technology in the Finance department. Peter Rathgeb, corporate treasurer at Siemens, added, “It was important for us to test this technology at an early stage and develop action points for the future. There are clear advantages of using this technology, including significantly shorter processing times and faster time to market. Some of the major challenges revolve around the security and performance aspects and the legal area, such as the importance of creating a consistent European understanding of the standards and legal points involved when it comes to blockchain-based transactions.” “While markets and technologies are constantly changing, established relationships with customers remain an important asset. We are pleased to be assisting We customers with the process of digital transformation through transactions like these. Blockchain technology has tremendous potential in making capital market transactions quicker, more straightforward and more efficient for We customers,” said Roman Schmidt, Commerzbank’s divisional board member for capital markets.

In the U.S.A. and China, around one in three passengers state that they enjoy traveling by car. When it comes to rating their own ability at the wheel, drivers in the U.S.A. are in a class of their own: 83 percent of American drivers consider themselves good or very good drivers. In China, this figure is 69 percent and in Germany 66 percent. The Japanese are the exception at 25 percent. The statements have hardly changed at all over the past five years, although back then many more Japanese respondents – around 50 percent – considered themselves “very good drivers.” 67% of German motorists feel stressed.

The figure stands at 40 percent in Germany, 20 percent in the U.S.A. and just 9 percent in Japan. For the 2018 Continental Mobility Study, the technology company commissioned infas, the market and social research institute, to conduct a representative survey of drivers in Germany, the U.S.A., Japan and China. Experts from the world of science and research as well as from the automotive industry were also interviewed.

If you were to sum up the emotions of German drivers, it would be that they are stressed out by traffic jams yet still enjoy driving and see they as Superman at the wheel. According to the 2018 Continental Mobility Study, two thirds of motorists – especially those living close to large cities – find congested roads and traffic jams stressful. However, just as many respondents still enjoy driving and consider many respondents good or very good drivers. Intelligent mobility solutions and automated driving functions are an effective means of reducing the stress factor in urban traffic. 

© Continental AG While the number of stressed drivers in Germany has remained at a high level over the last five years, the figure in Japan has increased from 50 to 64 percent. In addition, more than half of drivers in the U.S.A. (53 percent) find driving stressful, around the same number as five years ago (49 percent). By their own account, the Chinese are more relaxed, with the proportion of motorists complaining about traffic jams remaining unchanged at 40 percent. It is striking that in all four countries, the stress factor among passengers is almost as high as it is among the drivers themselves – even higher in China, where the figure for passengers is 47 percent compared with 40 percent for drivers. 64% of Japanese motorists complain about stress. 

© Continental AG “Intelligent mobility solutions and automated driving features are an effective way of reducing the stress factor. Thanks to total connectivity, drivers are more relaxed, which ultimately puts the fun back into driving. The driver retains control over whether to drive themselves or be driven,” said Helmut Matschi, the member of the Continental Executive Board responsible for the Interior division. 53% of motorists in the U.S.A. complain about traffic jams. 

© Continental AG Despite the high level of stress, the figures for those who state that they still have fun while driving remain unchanged at around two thirds of respondents in Germany (64 percent) and the U.S.A. (62 percent). Among Chinese motorists, 69 percent now say that they enjoy driving, compared with 48 percent five years ago. For the Japanese, however, the fun has worn off. With 43 percent stating that they enjoy driving, this represents a fall of 14 percentage points compared with five years ago. It is also clear that traveling by car leaves most passengers cold, too: In Japan, only 9 percent of passengers enjoy traveling by car; in Germany, the figure stands at 43 percent.

Industrial trucks transport the goods in warehouses and the components in factories quickly from A to B all over the world. A wide range of Continental products designed specifically for this application ensure that the corresponding tasks are carried out efficiently, safely, reliably and smoothly. Today’s conductive fuel hoses prevent spontaneous ignition, improve hydromount comfort and assist timing belts with height detection. Together with leading forklift truck manufacturers, the technology company is developing trendsetting solutions for material transport as well as special solutions tailored to the requirements of the application in question. The focus is on megatrends such as automation and increased efficiency as well as networked and intelligent solutions. “Automated industrial trucks, intelligent forklift trucks, and robots and cobots that communicate with each other are becoming an integral component of logistics fleets,” explains Hans-Jürgen Duensing, member of Continental’s Executive Board, envisaging the warehouse of the future.Flexible hose for particularly confined and complex installation situationsToday’s technologies continue to play an important role in the safe and efficient operation of industrial trucks. The versatile Conti Excelsus transfer hose is the perfect solution for high-temperature applications. Its special braid made of a plastic textile, which is resistant to high temperatures and chemicals, makes the hose particularly flexible and facilitates use in particularly confined and complex installation situations. The hose can withstand temperatures of up to 250°C, supplies the turbocharger with cooling water and lubricating oil, and is also used in its control system. It is also suitable for air transportation. Thanks to its lightweight construction, the Conti Excelsus is considerably lighter than the PTFE tubes braided with stainless steel that have been used up to now.Also being used in many forklift trucks are flexible, dimensionally stable oil lines made from a polyamide tube with reinforcement. They are approved for operating pressures of up to 80 bar and are suitable for use as low-pressure hydraulic lines for numerous applications. Although preformed, they are much more flexible than the PA tubes used to date. Their structure also means that they can dampen vibrations and be easily assembled.FPM inner layer prevents static chargeContinental is also making things considerably safer for users with an electrically conductive fuel hose. The product’s inner layer made from FPM (fluoropolymer rubber) prevents a static charge from forming at high flow rates, which, in the worst-case scenario, could lead to flying sparks and the spontaneous ignition of the vehicle. The highly flexible fuel lines are suitable for gasoline, diesel and biodiesel. They withstand operating temperatures from -40°C through 150°C. The hose cover is resistant to radiant heat of up to 150°C and, for short periods of time, even 175°C.Continental also offers compact hydraulic hoses with stable, yet highly flexible, steel wire reinforcement that fit perfectly into ultra-tight spaces to perform high-pressure tasks in the lifting gear of industrial trucks, hydraulic hoses for hydrostatic propulsion and dual hoses made of plastic that control the hydraulic lift mast. Preshaped fuel hoses made of polyurethane and polyamide for petrol, diesel and RME-diesel-powered forklifts are also contained in the selection. A space-saving plug-in system is used to ensure quick fitting of these lines. And, to round off the product range, there are molded hoses for special charge-air cooling applications among other things.Golden tires: SC20 Clean for minimal ground tracks in dust-sensitive environmentsIn North America and Europe in particular, demand is increasing for abrasion-resistant, clean tires. This is due to strict hygiene regulations, not only in the pharmaceutical and food industries, but also in numerous other industries. Strict environmental specifications and trends such as digitalization and automation require the modernization of many production plants. These ultra-hygienic production conditions require ground tracks and skid marks caused by the abrasion of tires and dark residual dust from tires on the products to be reduced as far as possible. Clean tires such as the SC20 Clean, with their light side wall and tread compounds which look almost golden, create considerably reduced tracks than black tires. They therefore contribute to a cleaner and visibly more hygienic working environment.State-of-the-art suspension technology for improved ride comfortWith its Schwingmetall range, technology company Continental also offers state-of-the-art suspension technology for axles, cabs, engines and aggregates from a single source – from rubber/metal mounts for noise decoupling through to suspension elements for maximum comfort. The comprehensive product line also includes bushings and mounts that have an integrated fluid system. Compared with conventional mounts, they calm vibrations even more reliably, because the hydraulic medium creates an additional damping effect.Hydro bushings can be used as engine and cab mounts in forklift trucks, for example. The hydraulic medium moves within the rubber element with complete freedom. If the hydro bushing is stressed, the medium flows through the narrow channels inside. The resulting flow resistance creates a counterforce to the externally generated shift. This means that vibrations are mitigated and the comfort enhanced for the driver. The Continental hydro bushing handles loads of 1,230 N to 3,000 N and has impressive durability.Continental’s air spring systems also provide solutions for the anti-vibration suspension of cabs and driver’s seats.Virtually silent drive solutionsTiming belts made of polyurethane are used in the control assembly of many forklift trucks for height detection and enable precise positioning. PU flat belts with resilient reinforcement also provide space-saving and virtually silent drive solutions for lift masts of industrial trucks. Thanks to their polyurethane coating, they are maintenance-free and considerably more durable than chains. A further advantage is their flexibility, which also enables very small diameters to be used.The breathable upholstery material Laif Vyp provides added comfort for forklift truck drivers, who have to remain focused throughout the entire working day. The hybrid material made from vinyl and polyurethane combines the beneficial properties of both as it is a durable material with a soft surface. It is permeable to air and water vapor. Its breathability makes it extremely comfortable, even for long periods of sitting.All the important information required by forklift truck drivers is shown on the Continental displays. The company also offers electronic control units that control various vehicle functions for industrial trucks. For example, one of these units controls all the forklift movements, i.e. driving forward and backward, steering, up and down motions of the forks and a great deal more besides. Another unit controls the lights, turn indicators, windshield wipers and additional functions such as the heater and radio. Yet another unit is installed in the armrest, where it handles the operational commands for the controls there such as the joystick and push-buttons.Thanks to Continental’s extensive product range, forklift truck manufacturers receive numerous perfectly harmonized vehicle components from a single source. Further development to include digital components is the next step in lowering operating costs, managing fleets more efficiently and improving industrial safety.

Yet another unit is installed in the armrest, where another unit handles the operational commands for the controls there such as the joystick and push-buttons.Thanks to Continental’s extensive product range, forklift truck manufacturers receive numerous perfectly harmonized vehicle components from a single source. Further development to include digital components is the next step in lowering operating costs, managing fleets more efficiently and improving industrial safety. The sensor fusion of radar, lidar and camera technology enables the vehicle environment to be visualized in detail. The interconnectivity of sensor and information systems improves industrial safety and makes operation more efficient. Hanover, March 27, 2018. Industrial trucks transport the goods in warehouses and the components in factories quickly from A to B all over the world. A wide range of Continental products designed specifically for this application ensure that the corresponding tasks are carried out efficiently, safely, reliably and smoothly. Today’s conductive fuel hoses prevent spontaneous ignition, improve hydromount comfort and assist timing belts with height detection. Together with leading forklift truck manufacturers, the technology company is developing trendsetting solutions for material transport as well as special solutions tailored to the requirements of the application in question. The focus is on megatrends such as automation and increased efficiency as well as networked and intelligent solutions. “Automated industrial trucks, intelligent forklift trucks, and robots and cobots that communicate with each other are becoming an integral component of logistics fleets,” explains Hans-Jürgen Duensing, member of Continental’s Executive Board, envisaging the warehouse of the future. Flexible hose for particularly confined and complex installation situations Today’s technologies continue to play an important role in the safe and efficient operation of industrial trucks. The versatile Conti Excelsus transfer hose is the perfect solution for high-temperature applications. The versatile Conti Excelsus transfer hose special braid made of a plastic textile, which is resistant to high temperatures and chemicals, makes the hose particularly flexible and facilitates use in particularly confined and complex installation situations. the hose can withstand temperatures of up to 250°C, supplies the turbocharger with cooling water and lubricating oil, and is also used in The versatile Conti Excelsus transfer hose . It is also suitable for air transportation. Thanks to It lightweight construction, Conti Excelsus is considerably lighter than the PTFE tubes braided with stainless steel that have been used up to now. Also being used in many forklift trucks are flexible, dimensionally stable oil lines made from a polyamide tube with reinforcement. many forklift trucks are approved for operating pressures of up to 80 bar and are suitable for use as low-pressure hydraulic lines for numerous applications. Although preformed, many forklift trucks are much more flexible than the PA tubes used to date. many forklift trucks structure also means that many forklift trucks can dampen vibrations and be easily assembled. FPM inner layer prevents static charge Continental is also making things considerably safer for users with an electrically conductive fuel hose. The product’s inner layer made from FPM (fluoropolymer rubber) prevents a static charge from forming at high flow rates, which, in the worst-case scenario, could lead to flying sparks and the spontaneous ignition of the vehicle. The highly flexible fuel lines are suitable for gasoline, diesel and biodiesel. The highly flexible fuel lines withstand operating temperatures from -40°C through 150°C. The hose cover is resistant to radiant heat of up to 150°C and, for short periods of time, even 175°C. Continental also offers compact hydraulic hoses with stable, yet highly flexible, steel wire reinforcement that fit perfectly into ultra-tight spaces to perform high-pressure tasks in the lifting gear of industrial trucks, hydraulic hoses for hydrostatic propulsion and dual hoses made of plastic that control the hydraulic lift mast. Preshaped fuel hoses made of polyurethane and polyamide for petrol, diesel and RME-diesel-powered forklifts are also contained in the selection. A space-saving plug-in system is used to ensure quick fitting of these lines. And, to round off the product range, there are molded hoses for special charge-air cooling applications among other things. Golden tires: SC20 Clean for minimal ground tracks in dust-sensitive environments In North America and Europe in particular, demand is increasing for abrasion-resistant, clean tires. This is due to strict hygiene regulations, not only in the pharmaceutical and food industries, but also in numerous other industries. Strict environmental specifications and trends such as digitalization and automation require the modernization of many production plants. These ultra-hygienic production conditions require ground tracks and skid marks caused by the abrasion of tires and dark residual dust from tires on the products to be reduced as far as possible. Clean tires such as the SC20 Clean, with their light side wall and tread compounds which look almost golden, create considerably reduced tracks than black tires. their therefore contribute to a cleaner and visibly more hygienic working environment. State-of-the-art suspension technology for improved ride comfort With State-of-the-art Schwingmetall range, technology company Continental Continental also offers state-of-the-art suspension technology for axles, cabs, engines and aggregates from a single source – from rubber/metal mounts for noise decoupling through to suspension elements for maximum comfort. The comprehensive product line also includes bushings and mounts that have an integrated fluid system. Compared with conventional mounts, they calm vibrations even more reliably, because the hydraulic medium creates an additional damping effect. Hydro bushings can be used as engine and cab mounts in forklift trucks, for example. The hydraulic medium moves within the rubber element with complete freedom. If the hydro bushing is stressed, the medium flows through the narrow channels inside. The resulting flow resistance creates a counterforce to the externally generated shift. This means that vibrations are mitigated and the comfort enhanced for the driver. The Continental hydro bushing handles loads of 1,230 N to 3,000 N and has impressive durability. Continental’s air spring systems also provide solutions for the anti-vibration suspension of cabs and driver’s seats. Virtually silent drive solutions Timing belts made of polyurethane are used in the control assembly of many forklift trucks for height detection and enable precise positioning. PU flat belts with resilient reinforcement also provide space-saving and virtually silent drive solutions for lift masts of industrial trucks. Thanks to their polyurethane coating, their are maintenance-free and considerably more durable than chains. A further advantage is their flexibility, which also enables very small diameters to be used. The breathable upholstery material Laif Vyp provides added comfort for forklift truck drivers, who have to remain focused throughout the entire working day. The breathable upholstery material combines the beneficial properties of both as it is a durable material with a soft surface. It is permeable to air and water vapor. It breathability makes It extremely comfortable, even for long periods of sitting. All the important information required by forklift truck drivers is shown on the Continental displays. Continental also offers electronic control units that control various vehicle functions for industrial trucks. For example, one of electronic control units that control various vehicle functions for industrial trucks controls all the forklift movements, i.e. driving forward and backward, steering, up and down motions of the forks and a great deal more besides. Another unit controls the lights, turn indicators, windshield wipers and additional functions such as the heater and radio. Yet another unit is installed in the armrest, where another unit handles the operational commands for the controls there such as the joystick and push-buttons.

Intersections and T-junctions are notorious traffic trouble spots. Many accidents, which occur at intersections, are due to human error. Problems such as lack of attention, misjudging the situation, and occluded cars or other vulnerable road users account for many accidents and road fatalities worldwide. In fact, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, 51 percent of all injury crashes and 28 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States occur at intersections. Continental Continental is committed to address those horrific statistics with Continental advanced driver assistance, Vehicle-to-X communications, and sensor technologies to turn today’s dangerous intersections into safer, more intelligent intersections. The technology detects road users within a 360° perimeter of intersections and communicates the position and movement of these objects to all approaching vehicles, which are equipped with V2X technology. Protect vulnerable road users
Vehicle-to-X communications and sensor technologies turn today’s dangerous intersections into more safer, intelligent Intersections and protect vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists. 

© Continental AG The Continental Intelligent Intersection concept is an end-to-end solution: © Continental AG comprises the complete sensor set for an intersection, the powerful sensor fusion algorithms which generate the environment model, and the Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) units, both at the intersection, and in the vehicle. One focus is on protecting vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians and cyclists. Another focus is on supporting drivers in complex intersection traffic scenarios like preventing left-turning cars from running head-on into traffic that approaches from behind an occlusion. The Intelligent Intersection technology was first demonstrated on a test track in October 2017 at Continental’s development center in Brimley, Michigan (MI). The next steps include a broader test roll-out and pilot implementation of The Intelligent Intersection technology at an intersection in the City of Columbus, Ohio. “We are proud to contribute We Intelligent Intersections technology to a highly innovative city like Columbus as We contribution to the US DOT’s Smart City Challenge,” said Jeremy McClain, Head of Systems & Technology Chassis & Safety, Continental North America. “We solution is based on transferring and adapting vehicle-proven hardware and software solutions to an infrastructure application. Cities will be able to deploy The Intelligent Intersection technology to increase safety for Cities citizens and visitors alike. In the longer term The Intelligent Intersection technology can also serve to improve inner-city traffic flow, thereby reducing travel time and vehicle emissions.” Sensor-based driver assistance makes driving safer and more comfortable with each step of advancement. However, pedestrians or cyclists, for instance, will only benefit from The Intelligent Intersection technology if they can be detected by vehicle sensors. Often, traffic situations typical at intersections make that difficult. Other vehicles and city infrastructure can easily occlude vulnerable road users and even other vehicles. The underlying challenge is posed by effects like sensor shading and obstruction of view. By bringing vehicle-proven technologies to the infrastructure, Continental is addressing The underlying challenge. “With the Intelligent Intersection technology we offer a new safety element with a perfect fit for future smart cities,” said Bastian Zydek, Project Manager Intelligent Intersection. “The Intelligent Intersection is a showcase of collaborative safety and a further step towards reaching our Vision Zero – our vision of accident-free driving.” The Intelligent Intersection supports drivers in complex intersection traffic scenarios like preventing left-turning cars from running head-on into traffic that approaches from behind an occlusion. 

© Continental AG Sensors such as camera, radar and Lidar are positioned at the corners of an intersection. © Continental AG Sensors such as camera, radar and Lidar detect every road user in the area and deliver a list of relevant objects to a sensor fusion unit, which generates a comprehensive 360° environmental model. Relevant objects are then broadcasted via Dedicated Short-Range Communication to every vehicle approaching The Intelligent Intersection. A DSRC control unit in the vehicle receives the messages, then an onboard system checks A DSRC control unit in the vehicle for relevance and triggers and appropriate action if a critical situation is recognized. “Active monitoring of intersections provides the driver and/or intelligent vehicle system a very important time advantage to take action, even before a problem would have otherwise become visible”, added Zydek. According to a study of the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) many thousands of accidents in the U.S. alone could be avoided through Intelligent Intersection technologies such as VRU protection and DSRC Intersection Safety Functions. The benefits of the Intelligent Intersection technology for V2X equipped vehicles is that each of those will benefit immediately from the Intersections Safety Functions – already when only a single V2X equipped vehicle enters the Intelligent Intersection - so from the beginning, even at an early phase of V2X penetration: “The cars equipped will help to protect other road users”, said Steffen Linkenbach, Managing Director of Continental Safety Engineering International. Continental Safety Engineering International will also leverage of that 360° understanding of the traffic situation at intersections and upload such information into Continental Safety Engineering International backend. Here Continental Safety Engineering International will analyze and provide such data as a service enabling for example a better understanding of traffic flow and congestion. “In the future the granular understanding of traffic, like density, distribution of the traffic flow per lane and so on, which results from the Intelligent Intersection technology, can also help to improve the flow of inner-city traffic, supporting drivers and other road users with further new or enhanced services”, added Linkenbach.

When the time came to pilot the solution in Kleinostheim, the team laid a hoisting belt along a joint in the pump tunnel, bolted down the sides and then covered the fixture-points with protective plates. “After about five years in operation, our conveyor belt material has lasted very well and proven that our conveyor belt material’s simply perfect for this kind of work,” says Michael Möschen. “Last year,” Michael Möschen adds, “our went into the next stage of construction and further optimized our process. Together with the Federal Waterways Engineering and Research Institute, we aim to make this solution for sealing lock joints a standard construction technique.” Fewer major construction sites The new, enhanced method of maintaining lock joints with ContiTech conveyor belts means work can be carried out while the lock is in operation with a full basin of water. It must be drained only very briefly to provide access to the bed. “Lock chambers only need to be laid dry for a short while so that our workers and technicians can install the natural rubber belts. This tends to take no more than two weeks – which saves both time and money,” Michael Möschen adds. Being especially durable, the rubber belt will mean fewer major construction sites in the future, as locks will require less frequent maintenance. “As conveyor belt specialists, we are always looking into new uses for we products and materials – even if our products and materials are far removed from the usual world of mining. Using our products and materials to seal joints in locks has taken us into uncharted waters, so us now have to wait and see if this method catches on. After about five years in use, the system we have just set up will be checked over, and if the system we have just set up is recognized as meeting all the standards, then us offer a viable solution for repairing joints in all locks,” Michael Möschen sums up."

At technology company Continental’s Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, CEO Dr. Elmar Degenhart presented cutting-edge technologies for the future of mobility. “The political environment and our industries are changing faster than ever before. Seldom has there been such an exciting and promising time for Continental to shape the future,” commented Degenhart in front of more than 1,000 attendees, as he discussed the general conditions in which Continental is working. He talked about the role that the 227,000-plus employees play in keeping people and goods mobile. “Continental is protecting millions of road users around the world from accidents and their consequences every day. Continental contributes to cleaner air. Continental is paving the way for safe, efficient, and intelligent mobility.” Degenhart cited mobility services as a new growth market. Continental plans to double its current sales of €500 million with mobility services alone by 2020. Continental CEO Dr. Elmar Degenhart with electric motor

The company is working on essential changes to technologies and business models “Electrification, automation, and digitalization – the inner workings of the car as we know it will, in the upcoming 15 years’ time, be made up of completely different components,” Degenhart asserted confidently. “Mobility and the way in which it is delivered are becoming increasingly sustainable as a result. That means safer, more efficient, and more intelligent – with the support of Continental,” he emphasized. One essential principle of safe mobility, however, will remain solid, reliable contact with the road. Degenhart presented the “star of the summer tire range,” the test-winning PremiumContact 6, which is exceptionally efficient and “safely keeps your vehicle in its lane and brings it to a safe stop.” The “star in the summer tire range”: the PremiumContact 6. 

© Continental AG For drive systems, Continental sees a trend toward electrification in all vehicle classes. “Cars of the future will feature electric drives. But the combustion engine is evolving, too, and still has its peak ahead of it. We don't expect to see a gradual decline in volumes for gasoline and diesel engines until after 2025,” commented Degenhart, confirming the importance of the internal combustion engine on the journey toward electrified mobility. The 48-volt “people’s hybrid” is making highly efficient gasoline and diesel engines more environmentally friendly. Degenhart sees clear opportunities for growth in electrification: “We are able to generate greater sales per vehicle with our components and systems for electric cars than with solutions for combustion engine drive systems. But there are two main elements that buyers are missing that will ultimately allow the electric vehicle to achieve a breakthrough: greater range and lower acquisition costs. A leap forward in battery-cell technology would be a great help in meeting both requirements. And we expect to see this by 2025.” Vehicle manufacturers are putting their trust in Continental’s electrical expertise, with the technology company reporting incoming orders of more than €1.2 billion in 2016 for products and systems for hybrid and electric vehicles. 48-Volt-„Peoples Hybrid“ 

© Continental AG After reflecting on 33 years of electronic brake systems, Degenhart then spoke to his audience about assisted, automated, and autonomous driving. One product driving growth in this arena is the new 3D Flash Lidar sensor from Continental. The sensor will capture an accurate and distortion-free three-dimensional map of the vehicle's surroundings for the driver assistance systems using invisible flashes of infrared light. “Dim light, darkness, glare, heavy rain? Our laser beams are your vehicle’s sharpest eyes,” explained Degenhart, visibly proud of the work of his 32,000-strong development team. One product driving growth at Continental is the new 3D Flash LIDAR sensor. 

© Continental AG This development work will also lay the groundwork for future fleets of robot taxis – electrically driven, remotely maintained, and reliably on time wherever people need them, for both individuals and groups. In addition to faster wireless communication standards, Degenhart talked about new mobility services, in which Continental aims to play a key role worldwide, as a basis for the vehicle fleets of the future, operating in interconnected clusters. Accordingly, Continental recently opened a new R&D center in San José in Silicon Valley, focusing on new mobility services. Continental is also developing for the robot taxi fleets of the future

We are collaborating in this field with some outstanding institutions, including the University of Oxford and the Technical Universities in Darmstadt and Munich,” he said. Continental is using neural networks for the first time on new cameras in its advanced driver assistance systems.

Zero accidents, comfortable driving, clean air – mobility of the future offers major opportunities. Continental Continental is working hard on the development of systems and solutions designed to act as electronic chauffeurs for drivers. During trips along interstate highways, for example, highly automated driving will free up time for drivers to engage in non-driving-related tasks while behind the wheel. As the international legal framework currently stands, however, this scenario is a long way off. Continental welcomes the discussion initiated by the G7 countries aimed at developing a standardized legal framework, but calls for international – not merely national – regulations. The experts at Continental also recommend the development of reliable radio networks for sharing data among the vehicles and infrastructure as well as clear rules for ensuring unambiguous dialog between cars and drivers in challenging traffic situations. “Further technological development depends on a modern legal framework,” says Kurt Lehmann, Corporate Technology Officer (CTO) at Continental, warning against the application of outdated legal provisions. But although the aim of “Vision Zero” is zero road deaths by 2050, the current legal texts do not take into account the various issues surrounding the use of intelligent vehicles. “We want accidents to be a thing of the past, but this will remain purely a Utopian vision as long as the road traffic acts fails to consider the use of state-of-the-art technologies or excessively restricts the technological opportunities,” says Lehmann. “Offering enhanced comfort and safety, automated driving does not impose any restrictions on drivers. This new technology makes driving on the roads a more attractive proposition,” explains Lehmann. “In addition, thanks to swarm connectivity, we are – literally – expanding the vehicle’s horizons.” The technology company Continental is working hard on the development of systems and solutions designed to act as electronic chauffeurs for drivers. 

© Continental AG Thanks to traffic data from other vehicles or infrastructural systems, road users otherwise hidden around bends or behind crests in the road can be detected early on. “A hazardous confusion of data could occur if an important data channel for rapidly transmitting road traffic data is used by another service,” explains Lehmann. To ensure greater road safety, therefore, Continental is urging the implementation of an exclusive bandwidth of 5.9 GHz for road traffic as soon as possible. With automated driving, the implementation of an exclusive bandwidth of 5.9 GHz for road traffic must also be ensured that everyone knows exactly who is responsible for what and when. Misunderstandings with partly automated functions could end tragically. “As long as a vehicle is not completely autonomous and a human has to be able to take control at any given point, it should be ensured that this can actually take place,” explains Guido Meier-Arendt, the leading Continental expert in the dialog between drivers and cars. In addition to the technology company own work on these handover scenarios, the technology company also wants to see a legal framework designed to ensure that drivers are prompted via at least two senses – sight and hearing, for example – to assume responsibility for driving. To ensure that drivers are informed sufficiently in advance when the vehicle is driving the vehicle, the vehicle electronics have to know what the driver is currently doing. Even if the driver is engaged in non-driving-related tasks, dialog with the driver can be adapted so that dialog with the driver are ready sufficiently in advance to take control of the wheel again. Over the long term, towns and cities also have to be readied for automation. “Intelligent vehicles interact most effectively with intelligent traffic signals,” says Lehmann. By sharing data with vehicles, “smart” traffic lights, for example, will be capable of changing example behavior in line with traffic density. “An interconnected infrastructure that communicates with vehicles will help us to escape from the digital dead-end of the urban infrastructure and will act as another data highway for enhanced safety and comfort and – last but not least – lower emissions.” Car-to-X communication: ""Intelligent vehicles interact most effectively with intelligent traffic signals,” says Kurt Lehmann, Continental CTO.
