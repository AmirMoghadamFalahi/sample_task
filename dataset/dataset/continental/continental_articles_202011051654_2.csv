The novel pump storage uses the sea itself as its upper storage reservoir. The lower storage basin is formed by the hollow sphere on the seabed. When electricity is needed on shore, a valve at the opening of the sphere opens. The water flowing into the sphere powers a pump turbine that generates electricity via a generator. The current is then transmitted to shore via connecting cables. Excess electricity, such as any generated overnight, is used to pump the concrete sphere dry again. The hoses used as pressure equalization lines in the test model of the novel hollow-sphere storage power station were developed and manufactured by ContiTech in Korbach. Air can flow into the sphere through the hose when water is pumped out. That prevents insufficient pressure."", ""8_strong"": ""High External Pressure"", ""9_p"": ""The biggest challenge in developing the hose was handling the water depth of 100 meters, which corresponds to an external pressure of around 10 bar. To ensure that the hose can be used in these difficult conditions it was designed with safety factor 3 for an external pressure of 30 bar. An additional steel helix in the hose wall gives it the necessary mechanical stability. Lake Constance supplies around 4.5 million people with drinking water. Therefore the layers of the hose fulfill the requirements of the German Drinking Water Ordinance and the directives of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This ensures that it will not cause any changes to the taste or smell of the water."", ""10_p"": ""The Fraunhofer IWES in Kassel started the first test phase on November 9, 2016. This involved lowering the 20-metric-ton hollow sphere to the bottom of “the Swabian sea”, as Lake Constance is sometimes referred to in German, near Überlingen. During the four-week test researchers were able to successfully prove and test the function of the underwater pumped storage power station. As its next step, the Fraunhofer Institute plans another experiment with a large plant at a water depth of approx.700 meters. The difficulty is finding a suitable location that is close to land. This is necessary for technical reasons. Proximity to an offshore wind farm is less important. The only requirement is that a shared electricity network is used.""}"

International technology company and industry partner ContiTech is experiencing considerable growth potential thanks to increasing connectivity in the industrial sector. “Digitalization is a major opportunity for us to work with our customers to generate added value on a lasting basis. Because we are part of the overall value chain, we can establish the conditions this requires as a supplier and industry partner, and play a key part in shaping the industrial infrastructure. Intelligently connected systems, machinery and equipment pave the way for this. Which is why we’re working tirelessly to make our products and systems smarter and offer end-to-end solutions,” explains Hans-Jürgen Duensing, member of the Continental Executive Board responsible for the ContiTech division. From April 24 to 28, 2017, in Hall 6, Stand F18, ContiTech will be presenting its smart solutions for industrial applications under the strapline “ContiTech.Smart Solutions Beyond Rubber.”"", ""6_p"": ""Intelligent surface material: The translucent cover material Acella Hylite produces special lighting effects. \n\n© ContiTech"", ""7_p"": ""One of the distinguishing features of the fourth industrial revolution is the intelligent connectivity of production and maintenance processes.

Going forward, predictive maintenance – the anticipatory maintenance and repair of machinery and equipment – will be a key driver of growth and efficiency in a large number of the industries in which we operate,” adds Duensing. The Hannover Messe trade fair will see ContiTech unveil its permanently installable and digitally connected monitoring system for steel cord conveyor belts for the first time.."", ""8_p"": ""Whether in open-pit or underground mining, for steep inclines or across distances spanning kilometers – conveyor belts are the beating heart of many industrial sectors. In harsh operating conditions, they transport loads weighing several tons not to mention sharp, hot, oily and greasy goods. Smooth running of these belts is crucial for cost efficiency. If the belt system experiences an extended downtime, the entire production chain frequently collapses. This in turn results in considerable sales losses for the operators. To allow conveyor belt systems to run free of faults and cost-effectively in the long term, even when subjected to high loads, the operators are focusing more and more on prevention. Innovative electronic monitoring systems make it possible to identify the exact condition of the conveyor belts at any time."", ""9_p"": ""“The monitoring system Conti MultiProtect helps to detect damage such as longitudinal slitting or splice faults on the conveyor belt at an early stage during operation and repair the damage in good time. This helps us to avoid extended downtimes,” explains ContiTech application engineer Patrick Raffler. \n\n© ContiTech\n\n\n\n“More serious damage such as longitudinal slitting or splice faults on the conveyor belt can have serious consequences for system operation, and lead to total failures in a worst-case scenario. The monitoring system Conti MultiProtect helps to detect such damage at an early stage during operation and repair the damage in good time. This helps us to avoid extended downtimes,” explains application engineer Patrick Raffler. The way it works is that rip inserts implanted into the conveyor belt are checked for longitudinal slitting by means of their characteristic magnetic fields. Using RFID (radio-frequency identification) chips, ContiTech has been able to optimize localization of longitudinal slitting on the belt. Conti MultiProtect is also able to monitor the condition of the joints and identify damaged spots within the carcass. The user-friendly system has an intuitive operating design that uses a graphical interface.“This permanent monitoring gives us a detailed picture of the condition of the conveyor belts at all times without having to interrupt operations. This allows cover repairs to be scheduled preventively in good time, thereby reducing maintenance costs,” says Raffler, outlining the advantages further. ContiTech is using software developed in house. “We’re putting our longstanding expertise to good use in the development of intelligent software solutions. This enables us to assist our customers in the best way we can. The new system permits more-accurate-than-ever monitoring of steel cord conveyor belts,” says Raffler.Other product highlights at Hannover MesseContiTech will also showcase a new development for its ViProtect app designed for iOS and Android systems at this year’s Hannover Messe. The app allows users to analyze vibrations in driver cabs, engines and other industrial devices using a smartphone. Excessive vibrations put too much strain on the components, and this can result in expensive and time-consuming downtimes and repairs. Taking accurate measurements helps to assess the vibration behavior of industrial vehicles and machinery. The app uses this data to find the right solution and suggests options for a suitable bearing system – thereby helping to increase service life and comfort over the long term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing vibrations using a smartphone: ContiTech will showcase a new development for its\nViProtect app designed for iOS and Android systems at this year’s Hannover Messe. \n\n© ContiTech\n\n\n\nThe company will also be presenting its latest development for intelligent surface materials.

the FIFA 2006, 2010 and 2014 World Cups and the UEFA EURO 2008, 2012 and 2016 events – and of the UEFA Champions League from 1995 to 2000. Football sponsorship has proved a highly efficient way to greatly enhance the visibility of the premium Continental tire brand in almost all European markets. “We are delighted at the long-term positive impact of our commitment to the sponsorship of professional football events. It enabled us to set ourselves apart in an appealing way from many of our competitors who, in the late 1990s, primarily opted for a commitment to motor sport, and it has generated a major boost in brand recognition in our main European markets,” says Nikolai Setzer, member of the Executive Board of Continental AG responsible for Corporate Purchasing and the Tire division at the world’s fourth largest tire manufacturer with sales of more than €10 billion."", ""41_p"": ""“When the UEFA EURO 2016 event drew to a close we had achieved the brand recognition targets we had set for the communication platform that football provided.

Against this backdrop, the motto of the new marketing campaign – “Mobility enhanced by German technology” – was an obvious choice. “We are convinced that this is the logical target positioning for Continental, because no other tire manufacturer or automotive supplier in the world commands this unique combination of tire technology and automotive competence.

Going forward, German expertise in terms of tire technology and automotive engineering will be at the heart of not only our daily development efforts but also our marketing and communications activities.”"", ""49_p"": ""Silke Gliemann, Head of Marketing Communications in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region"", ""50_p"": ""The new campaign will be run across Europe on television, in print media, at the point of sale with the company’s partners in the trade, and online. Continental is also planning to make active use of the various social media channels to engage in dialogue with drivers and other social media users and explain the benefits of the mobility solutions the company can offer. “As well as creating a more modern and vital presence, as we developed the campaign we made sure to generate greater flexibility than in the past. This is reflected, for example, in the more varied selection of images we use to illustrate a range of different topics, helping to set us clearly apart from the competition in the replacement sector,” says Silke Gliemann who, together with her team, is responsible for marketing communications in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. So in the future a variety of driving scenarios will be featured in different settings to build and boost confidence in Continental’s mobility solutions. The new campaign was drawn up in conjunction with Serviceplan Campaign International GmbH & Co. KG in Hamburg and will be gradually rolled out across Europe. Production of the television spots was handled by Markenfilm GmbH & Co. KG, also based in Hamburg."", ""51_p"": ""In terms of content strategy, both the new campaign and the tire manufacturer’s dedicated website www.VisionZeroWorld.com are aligned with Vision Zero. The overall offering will include a broad spectrum of multimedia content referencing the topic of greater road safety through accident prevention technologies. Along with a new quarterly VisionZeroNews format, there will also be numerous reports and articles available on the various technologies, as well as videos and graphics – some animated. One ongoing focus of coverage will of course be on Continental’s engagement as an automotive supplier and exclusive tire partner to Global NCAP’s “Stop the Crash” campaign, which aims to spread the word about precisely these accident prevention technologies, particularly in densely populated emerging economies. From Continental’s viewpoint as a technology company, Stop the Crash is ideally aligned with its future target positioning, given that the campaign is based on providing information and building awareness by familiarizing people with the different technologies. Under the aegis of Global NCAP and its regional sister organizations, Stop the Crash adopts a partnership-based approach involving most of the world's major automotive suppliers and other leading organizations, such as German automobile club ADAC, and targets not only political decision-makers and fleet managers but also journalists and drivers.""}"

A basic requirement for sophisticated advanced driver assistance systems and automated driving is the ability to reliably perceive vehicle surroundings and evaluate them accurately on-the-fly. The international technology company Continental is working on the next generation of an environment model that will deliver a seamless, true-to-life, 360-degree view of the entire vehicle’s surroundings. To allow automated vehicles to assume control from drivers, the vehicle must continuously acquire, process, and interpret data, while also acquiring and building up contextual knowledge. This is the only way to achieve sophisticated levels of automated driving that are able to master anything from straightforward freeway driving to the highly complex urban environment. A reliable environment model requires a range of information, for example of other traffic participants, of static objects such as road boundaries, of the vehicle’s own precise location, and of traffic control measures. “In order for the system to acquire this information step-by-step, a range of sensors such as radars, cameras, and Surround View systems are needed. The aim is to achieve an understanding of the vehicle’s surroundings which is as good as or better than a person’s own understanding.

In addition to extra, for example backend information, other sensors are needed for enhancing reliability and robustness as well as for further redundancy. “This is why we are working on a High Resolution 3D Flash LIDAR, which is ideal for fulfilling the strict requirements regarding vehicle surroundings monitoring. The sensor captures and processes real-time 3D machine vision and does not contain any mechanical components,” Haupt said. The data from the various sensors can be processed in either the individual sensor or on a central control unit, constructing a high-precision environment model of the vehicle’s surroundings. The greater the data volume to be processed and analyzed, the more computing power is needed. This, in turn, drives the need for control units that are more powerful than the ones currently in use today, in order to construct and manage the environment model. The environment model represents an intermediate software layer between the individual sensors and the different applications. This layer contains data fusion and planning algorithms designed to enhance accuracy and reliability and to expand the field of vision from the individual sensors, acting as an abstraction layer with respect to the different functions.

The world’s first hybrid drives that run on 48-volts come from the Continental plant in Nuremberg. Continental is electrifying one diesel variant of both the new Renault Scénic and Grand Scénic models. The system, offered as a \""Hybrid Assist\"" uses a 48-volt hybrid drive in production vehicles for the first time. Just three years after the start of the project, the location developed a modular manufacturing concept that it could use to manufacture efficiently and in line with the cost structures of the volume market. To do so, the supplier invested around €15 million in new production equipment. Using the currently installed equipment, up to 200,000 vehicles can be furnished with 48-volt drives. A modular concept means that products for various automotive manufacturers can be produced with this equipment. The products differ in terms of their size, output or connections – for cooling, for instance. Location Head Rainer Pühl points towards further growth potential: “The manufacturing concept is designed so that completely identical equipment can also be constructed in other regional markets at a later date, for instance in China or the U.S.”"", ""6_p"": ""© Continental AG"", ""7_p"": ""Hybridization with a 48-volt drive results in an especially favorable cost-benefit ratio. Although the continuous electrical output of six kilowatts is relatively low, it allows the system to recover the majority of the kinetic energy that would otherwise be converted into heat during braking. This reduces fuel consumption in the new European driving cycle by up to 13 percent. In real-world use – especially in cities – the savings are even higher thanks to the greater share of driving spent in energy recuperation phases, and can reach up to 21 percent. Rudolf Stark, Head of the Hybrid Electric Vehicle Business Unit, explains: “When industrializing the 48-volt systems, we closely coordinated the development of product and production processes from the start in order to ensure cost-effective production. This is necessary in order to bring large quantities of the technology to market.

Tire manufacturer Continental has long ranked among the leaders in this OE business. The number of manufacturer approvals for Continental tires is constantly increasing: While the first ever SportContact that made its debut in 1994 attracted some 100 approvals, the predecessors of the new PremiumContact 6 brought in 400 or so.

At the same time, the number of tire approvals required for each different model of car is also on the increase. Whereas, for example, in 1980 that archetypal SUV – the Land Rover III – had a single approved tire option for a 16-inch rim, today the latest Porsche Macan has some 20 approvals in sizes from 18 to 21 inches. Other premium models offer an even wider range of tire options."", ""15_p"": ""There are, in fact, many different reasons for this increase in the number of approvals. Today’s models each have a far wider range of equipment levels and engine options, which are of course reflected in their tire and rim sizes. National and regional consumer preferences also play a part here: Consumers in Europe, for example, expect very short braking distances and perfect handling, accompanied by low rolling resistance. Asian drivers, by contrast, look for comfort, while Americans expect mileage first and foremost and traditionally fit all-season tires."", ""16_p"": ""Against this backdrop, the OE specialists at Continental are anticipating a further rise in the number of different OE specifications. Another reason is the very different demands that cars with internal combustion engines and electric cars place on their tires. The significance of these electric models is sure to increase long term – particularly in large cities with several million inhabitants and megacities that are home to as many as 20 million people. And even those population figures are set to increase.""}"

October 20, 2016. For years, the automotive industry has been talking about introducing mild hybrid systems based on 48-volt technology. Continental has now begun volume production of the first low-voltage hybrid drive, which will be introduced by French carmaker Renault (model: Renault Scenic Hybrid Assist) from the end of 2016. The first production solution combines an efficient, water-cooled induction motor with an integrated inverter. The electric motor transmits power via a belt drive directly to the crankshaft of the combustion engine – an arrangement referred to by experts as \""P0 topology.\"" Further production ramp-ups are soon to be set in motion on the basis of a modular system for 48-volt drives."", ""5_p"": ""The 48-volt technology is regarded as a technology of the future, as the low voltage compared with conventional hybrid vehicles enables considerable savings in fuel consumption in return for moderate additional costs. Consequently, Continental anticipates that market penetration will be rapid, with four million vehicles with low-voltage hybrid drives to be produced worldwide in 2020. For 2030, the technology supplier's experts forecast a global market of as many as 25 million new vehicles. During development of the modular system, the engineers at Continental therefore placed great emphasis on achieving a high degree of efficiency for the overall system, simple adaptation to existing vehicle powertrain designs, and highly automated, cost-effective production."", ""6_p"": ""Belt driven starter generator (48-volt electric drive) from Continental \n\n© Continental AG\n\n\n\nThe efficiency of a 48-volt system is largely dependent on the amount of drive and recovery output available in continuous operation. As a result, Continental has chosen to employ a water-cooled induction motor that can be connected directly to the engine's cooling circuit. This makes it possible to assemble a machine that, depending on the version, can continuously provide an output of six kilowatts and torque of 60 newton meters, all in the installation space of a conventional starter alternator. Using a belt drive means that up to 150 newton meters can be transmitted to the crankshaft. Within the modular system, only the length of the motor changes the power. The inverter, based on a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), is integrated in the housing lid, which saves space. The modular system from Continental also includes a DC/DC converter, which enables the 48-volt system to be connected to the vehicle's on-board power supply. This makes it possible to use some of the energy stored in the lithium-ion battery to stabilize the on-board power supply as well. Simple adaptation to existing powertrain designs is a major benefit of the P0 concept that Continental has pursued. It enables the load point of the combustion engine to be shifted. The fuel savings demonstrated in test vehicles are considerable, with a figure of 13 percent in the New European Driving Cycle. In real-world use – especially in cities – the savings are even higher thanks to the greater share of driving spent in energy recuperation phases, and can reach up to 21 percent. This is helped by the fact that the combustion engine can be switched off when the vehicle approaches traffic lights, starting at speeds below 20 km/h. The combustion engine is always started with the 48-volt drive within just 0.2 seconds – a conventional starter needs roughly twice as much time. When the 48-volt drive is combined with a diesel engine as in its first production application, there is an additional effect. This is that the nitrogen oxide emissions produced during acceleration from low engine speeds fall by up to 10 percent, as some of the necessary torque is generated via the electric motor. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe worldwide first 48-volt hybrid drive from Continental in production at Renault Scenic Hybrid Assist.

As well as optimizing all components for the P0 arrangement, the focus will be on another system configuration, for with the P2 arrangement, the electric motor is located between the engine and the transmission. It can therefore be operated entirely independently of the combustion engine, which means that electric driving at speeds of temporarily up to 50 km/h is possible with a 48-volt drive as well.

How can valuable information for the individual road user be gleaned from huge mountains of data? The answer to this will be given by the international technology company Continental at the IZB from October 18 to 20 in Wolfsburg (hall 1, booth 1302). The focus is on, among other things, the Road Database which, in combination with other vehicle systems, is a basic element of intelligent mobility and the more advanced levels of automated driving. \""We want to show our customers how we can work together to implement the vision of accident-free driving, step by step, and also create considerable added value for individual mobility such as logistics while we are on the road to achieving this goal,\"" says Continental manager Sven-Uwe Niemann of the goals of this trade fair appearance."", ""5_p"": ""\""Even for experienced professionals in the automotive business, it is not always easy to show them how discernible benefits for the end user can be gained from Cloud and Big Data.

Applied to the Continental Road Database, this means that the more vehicles and manufacturers that use the system, the more accurate and up-to-date the information provided about the road course, state of the road, traffic jams, or obstacles. The result is a classic win-win situation for everyone involved,\"" says Niemann."", ""8_p"": ""Road Database uses the modern vehicle sensors such as optical cameras, radar, and increasingly lidar, which continuously record a vast amount of the information required. In the future, further information on the condition of road will be added from other electronic control units – for example, the electronic brake system. The route data obtained in this way is checked by the on-board computer and compared with information about the route that has already been saved. This creates a digital image of the road and its attributes, which is wirelessly transmitted in anonymous format to the Continental data center. This center thus receives traffic images from numerous vehicles and uses them to create an overall picture, which is then sent back individually to connected vehicles."", ""9_p"": ""Future advanced driver assistance systems will build specifically on this very precise road information. They will cover a lot more than just road geometry and lane keeping and departure functions. Changing speed restrictions, temporary road works, or vehicles that have broken down will also be covered.

Around 20 percent of accidents involving trucks with pedestrians or cyclists occur when the vehicle is turning right – and this is why Continental, the international technology company decided to develop a system that assists truck drivers on right turns, making the roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists. ProViu®Detect detects the positions of road users and actively warns the driver when there is a risk of collision – also reducing the driver’s stress levels in complex traffic situations. “The right turn is one of the most difficult tasks in city traffic.

The system locates the road users and calculates the time until a possible collision could occur, based on the vehicle location. The advantage of this active system is that it first assesses whether or not the situation is critical. If there is a danger of collision, ProViu®Detect then uses for example a pulsating LED light strip in the vehicle cabin or an acoustic warning signal to warn the driver of the danger. The Continental experts can implement the different warning strategies upon request. A high-resolution sensor also ensures that ProViu®Detect reliably identifies objects in the surrounding environment."", ""7_p"": ""The system’s range of functions can be upgraded with various options and an adaptive, risk-sensitive concept that warns the driver in two stages is also available.

It has already conquered the mid-range cars, but it’s still new in the world of trucks – the head-up display (HUD). Continental is one of the world’s first companies to develop a HUD for commercial vehicles and has installed the technology in its own InnovationTruck. Supplementing conventional instrument clusters, the display provides the driver with greater safety and comfort by projecting a color image of important driving information into his field of vision. Continental offers manufacturers the display as a Windshield or a Combiner HUD. Customers can also choose to have the display shown in the upper or lower field of view (look-up or look-down concept)."", ""5_p"": ""The display options and the color schemes of the HUD are very varied and can be freely defined by the vehicle manufacturer. The display gets its data via the CAN bus and depending on the available sources, the display choices range from speed, navigation instructions and traffic sign warnings such as overtaking restrictions and speed limits, to distance warnings, gas tank levels and the driving time remaining until the next break. The driver gets all the important information exactly where he needs it – in his field of view. This increases safety, because he doesn’t have to take his eyes off the road for a second or two, as is the case with a conventional instrument cluster – and his eyes don’t have to focus on a shorter viewing distance before the flow of information starts and then adjust again to the longer-distance view. This refocusing process takes time and tires the eyes after a while."", ""6_p"": ""The Continental HUD is available as a Windscreen HUD, where the windshield serves as a mirror for the displayed information. This version is ideal for commercial vehicles with flatter windshields which are common in the USA. In the case of the Combiner HUD, a transparent pane (the combiner) handles the image reflection in front of the windshield. This version is particularly suitable for confined spaces with more steeply curved windshields, which are more common in Europe. The vehicle manufacturer can also choose whether the display should be shown in the upper or lower field of view (look-up and look-down approach). Continental offers the Windshield HUD in the look-down version as standard. The use of a head-up display also gives OEMs new opportunities in vehicle design. The instrument panel can be made smaller, for example, because all of its information content can be transferred to the HUD."", ""7_p"": ""“The head-up display makes a significant contribution to road safety. The driver can monitor events without getting tired because his eyes don’t have to continually switch back and forth between long-distance and short-range focusing. The HUD keeps him up-to-date about what’s happening in his vicinity, providing him with information like distance from the vehicle ahead, a traffic jam or sudden weather events like heavy rainfall,” explains Dr. Michael Ruf, Head of Business Unit Commercial Vehicles and Aftermarket. “The HUD is also an important technology in terms of the progressive automation of driving, because in its role as a human-machine interface, it can ideally provide the driver with information about the current automation mode. The driver must believe in the efficiency and performance of the machine and getting this information boosts his confidence.”"", ""8_p"": ""In developing the HUDs for commercial vehicles, Continental engineers used synergies within the Group and the know-how of their colleagues from the automobile sector, where Continental has long been a supplier for several manufacturers, delivering the first full-color HUD as far back as 2003.

945,2016-09-20,Press Release,What does “225/45 R 18 95 H SSR MOE M+S” mean?,"",https://www.continental-tires.com/www8/servlet/page/redirect/1196480,true,"{""headline"": ""What does “225/45 R 18 95 H SSR MOE M+S” mean?"", ""1_p"": ""Tire sidewalls are carrying more information than ever"", ""2_strong"": ""Tire sidewalls are carrying more information than ever"", ""3_p"": ""Decoding the information on tire sidewalls is getting tougher and tougher for the layman. And no wonder: The number of different specifications is steadily increasing, which means tire manufacturers like Continental, who supply original equipment, have to add more indicators to the sidewall. These sequences of numbers, letters and in some cases symbols can help you identify the right tire for your car. By way of example, in what follows, Continental decodes the sequence “225/45 R 18 95 H SSR MOE M+S”."", ""4_p"": ""The number “225” stands for the width of the tire in millimeters – so in this case the tire is 22.5 cm wide. The “45” that follows is the aspect ratio - the height of the tire sidewall as a percentage of its width. In our case that means 10.1 cm. Next up is an “R”, which means “radial” – today, radial tires have almost completely replaced the cross-ply tires that were the standard design until the 1980s. The figure “18” indicates the wheel rim diameter in inches, while “95” is the load index, indicating the maximum weight the tire can bear; 95 equates to 650 kg. Then comes the letter “H” which is the speed index, where “H” signals a maximum speed of 210 km/h. “SSR” indicates that this is a “SelfSupportingRunflat” tire. The abbreviation “MOE” tells us this is a Mercedes original equipment tire with runflat properties (E = extended mobility). The number of these manufacturer-specific codes is set to rise even further in years to come as more and more automakers submit their own specifications to the leading tire manufacturers. The final element “M+S” stands for “mud and snow” – so this is a winter tire or an off-highway model. Anyone looking for a safe winter tire should also look out for the snowflake symbol on the sidewall, because tires with this symbol have proven their grip on snow in a standardized test."", ""5_p"": ""Along with this data, the tire sidewall carries lots of other information, too. One important item for drivers is the production date, indicated by what’s called the DOT code. It’s made up of the letters DOT and two pairs of figures, separated by a forward slash. The first two numbers show the week the tire was built; the last two indicate the year. So “36/16” means the tire was built in the 36th calendar week (i.e. between September 5 and 11) in 2016. Drivers looking for these codes on their tires should inspect both sidewalls, as there are indicators on both sides – which on the vehicle can mean on the inner wall, too.""}"

This has been made possible by a lining that is applied to the inside of the tire tread, after the actual production process. This special foam layer significantly dampens the airborne vibrations caused by the rolling of the tire, so that on all surfaces, the noise penetrating the vehicle interior is reduced by up to nine decibels – meaning increased comfort for the occupants. Because all other aspects, including the profile, of normal production tires can be transferred, in terms of driving characteristics such as braking, handling, or behavior in wet conditions as well as in the case of the rims and fitting, there is no difference from other tires from the same product family."", ""4_p"": ""Audi is the first vehicle manufacturer to equip its RS 6 Avant and RS 7 Sportback models with ContiSilent tires from the ContiSportContact 5 P series.

At the 66th IAA Commercial Vehicles in Hanover (September 22–29), the international technology company Continental will present a solution for close coupled exhaust gas aftertreatment systems in heavy commercial vehicles. Positioning the diesel oxidation catalytic converter (DOC) near the engine means that the volume of the DOC can be reduced by around 30%. At the same time, using the recently developed catalyst substrate featuring the CS-Design® (Crossversal Structure – see details below) can additionally decrease the weight of the DOC by 20%. The low level of heat loss and the high degree of conversion efficiency of the innovative CS cell structure will help to meet future nitrogen oxide emission limits such as those set out in the CARB 2023 (California Air Resources Board) regulation in the U.S.A. Thanks to the higher working temperature in the DOC, the subsequent injection of the urea solution can begin earlier. In addition to the DOC, the solution to be presented in Hanover also includes the urea dosing system integrated in the tank, the SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) control unit, and the metallic catalyst substrate for complete evaporation of the urea solution."", ""5_p"": ""Catalyst substrate in CS-Design®: The catalytic converter works best when the exhaust gas pollutants constantly come into contact with the catalytic coating of the catalyst substrate and the optimum reaction temperature is reached. Continental has developed metal foils that generate a structured turbulence and are therefore more efficient than comparable, conventional catalytic converters. \n\n© Continental AG"", ""6_p"": ""“Until now, positioning the DOC in close coupled position to the engine in heavy commercial vehicles was impossible due to the installation space available,” says Dr. Markus Distelhoff, Head of the Fuel & Exhaust Management Business Unit of the Continental Powertrain Division. “Incorporating a particularly lightweight and efficient catalyst substrate, our solution now makes it possible to achieve compact, square geometries that can be positioned close to the engine, thereby opening up a number of advantages.”"", ""7_p"": ""Thanks to the reduced material used in the DOC, the new close coupled catalytic converter solution with at least the same high level of overall system efficiency, is more cost-effective than previous exhaust gas aftertreatment solutions, which were fitted to the chassis between the axles.

However, in other operating situations, engines hardly release any heat. Although this benefits the fuel efficiency level it presents a challenge to exhaust gas aftertreatment systems. If the exhaust gas is already at a low temperature at the engine, a long pipe section between the engine and the exhaust gas aftertreatment system, fitted to the chassis between the wheels, is even more disadvantageous as the exhaust gas continues to cool. Particularly in inner-city traffic, it can be difficult to ensure an adequate conversion temperature. Installing the DOC close to the engine changes this. With this set-up, heat loss through the flow path can be disregarded. As the efficiency of the DOC increases with the operating temperature, the volume of the DOC can be reduced. As such, when Continental carried out a test with the DOC near the engine, it was able to reduce the volume of the DOC by 30% from 11.3 to 7.8 liters.Continental uses the new CS catalyst substrate in its solution, where the DOC is installed near the engine. With this corrugated foil material, the waved structure exhibits a slight slant angle (hence the name Crossversal Structure, “CS”). By combining alternating left and right diagonal waves, the DOC structure manages without an intermediate foil for the first time. As a result, the amount of materials used and the weight decrease by 20%. At the same time, the efficiency of the NOx converter increases as the diagonal course of the waves generates turbulence, which brings nitrogen oxide in exhaust gas in better contact with the catalytic-coated surface of the substrate.Positive Effects of Installation near the EngineIn diesel passenger cars, installing the DOC near the engine is now routine. This trend cannot be implemented so quickly for heavy commercial vehicles in particular, as the underlying chassis has a very long service life.

As a result, NOx conversion starts earlier.” The higher temperature in conjunction with the structured metallic foil materials, on which the urea solution is sprayed, results in the complete evaporation of the urea solution. This prevents the build-up of deposits downstream. These deposits would restrict cross sections, impair the control quality of the exhaust gas aftertreatment system and destroy gas-conveying components such as flexible elements.With the long-term and likely complete re-location of the exhaust gas aftertreatment system towards the engine, the volume requirement for parts fitted to the chassis decreases, freeing up space for an increased fuel tank volume. “Installing the exhaust gas aftertreatment system near the engine is a prerequisite.

These then adapt the driving style and speed automatically. Continental is continuously developing this successful product.

At this level, the game in the vehicle can particularly increase the driver´s level of activation and attention compared to the simple monitoring of the automated driving system.

986,2016-06-20,Press Release,New Continental Turbocharger with Innovative RAAX™ Turbine Technology,"Developed by the global technology company Continental, the new gasoline turbocharger raises...",https://www.continental.com/en/press/press-releases/2017-06-20--turbocahrge-audi-99052,true,"{""headline"": ""New Continental Turbocharger with Innovative RAAX™ Turbine Technology now in Production on Audi A3"", ""1_strong"": ""Developed by the global technology company Continental, the new gasoline turbocharger raises the bar with a substantial improvement in response, efficiency and robust design"", ""2_strong"": ""The latest product will further strengthen Continental’s successful turbocharger business; production to begin in China in 2017 and in North America in 2018"", ""3_p"": ""Regensburg, Grünstadt, Trutnov (Czech Republic), June 20, 2016. The first Continental turbocharger with the innovative RAAX™ turbine technology, now in production on the Audi A3’s new 2.0-litre turbocharged gasoline engine (2.0l TFSI EA888, generation 3B), marks a new chapter in Continental’s successful turbocharger business. Significantly improved engine response is just one of the benefits of this new product. The automotive supplier Continental is a relative newcomer to the turbocharger market, having entered the arena in 2011, but has quickly earned itself a strong reputation. The Ford 1.0-liter EcoBoost gasoline engine, on which the first Continental turbocharger made its debut, promptly won the world’s top automotive engine award – the “International Engine of the Year” honor – three years in a row, between 2012 and 2014. In 2015 the honor was again bestowed on an engine equipped with a Continental turbocharger, in this case the hybrid powerplant of the BMW i8. “In the gasoline engine sector in particular, global demand for turbochargers is set to rise sharply. We are very well positioned in this market, and at Audi we are delighted to have been able to win over an important customer with our innovative and robust solutions,” says Wolfgang Breuer, Head of Continental’s Engine Systems Business Unit, which includes the Turbocharger Product Line. “RAAX™ technology, now in production in a corporate engine platform on the Audi A3, will help us further strengthen our market position. Additional growth will also be generated by the new plants we are building in China and North America, which are due to start turbocharger production in 2017 and 2018 respectively.”"", ""4_p"": ""The new-generation engine is an example of Audi’s “rightsizing” philosophy. This approach looks beyond downsizing and downspeeding, says Dr. Rainer Wurms, Head of Gasoline Engines Pre-Development at Audi AG: “Downsizing and downspeeding must also be precisely calibrated to vehicle class, engine power and real-world efficiency requirements. Rightsizing is about striking the right balance between these factors,” says Wurms. “An application-specific turbocharger is a key part of this approach. So we are delighted that, with close cooperation and support from our development partner Continental, we have found the perfect solution on this front.”"", ""5_p"": ""As denoted in the name RAAX™ (which stands for “radial-axial”), the new Continental turbocharger’s most important innovation is its modified turbine design. Unlike the most common type of gasoline turbocharger today, the radial turbocharger, which features a radial exhaust gas inlet, the new Continental turbocharger has a radial-axial (semi-radial/semi-axial) inlet path. The associated special blade design allows a substantial reduction of approximately 40 percent in the rotational moment of inertia of the turbine wheels. This means the turbocharger responds faster to engine load changes, so boost pressure is developed more quickly and turbo lag is minimized. In addition to this significant improvement in response, RAAX™ technology also results in up to 3 percent greater efficiency in the engine relevant operating range, leading to reduced emissions."", ""6_p"": ""© Continental AG"", ""7_strong"": ""High Robustness and Reliability"", ""8_p"": ""An innovative solution has also been implemented for the wastegate valve, which prevents boost pressure from rising too steeply at high engine output. Here the turbocharger team was able to leverage internal synergies, because Continental’s existing technology portfolio already features an electronic wastegate control system noted for its high reliability. In the new turbocharger, the wastegate actuator system has been adapted to provide a very robust solution for the actuator/wastegate linkage."", ""9_p"": ""Outstanding robustness, a hallmark of all Continental turbochargers, is further enhanced by a fully automated production system. Whereas conventional turbochargers have to be assembled in several stages, partly by hand, all the main components of the Continental turbocharger are designed for fully-automated, single-axis assembly. Using this production process, and intelligent quality control methods, Continental has raised the bar for quality in the turbocharger market."", ""10_strong"": ""“Benchmark Thermodynamics and Transient Response”"", ""11_p"": ""“Our RAAX™ turbocharger sets the standards today for both thermodynamics and transient response,” says Udo Schwerdel, Head of Continental’s Turbocharger Product Line. “This is also coupled with robust design and high quality, which are always a top priority in our development projects. These high quality standards are further underpinned by our standardized, state-of-the-art production methods, which we will be adopting at our new manufacturing sites too.” At present, Trutnov in the Czech Republic is Continental’s sole manufacturing site for the new turbocharger, but a further facility is already under construction in China. “From 2017, this plant will manufacture turbochargers for a number of volume production projects”, says Schwerdel. “Another facility is also under construction in North America. Production orders are already lined up for this new plant too, which is due to open in 2018.”"", ""12_p"": ""© Continental AG"", ""13_strong"": ""Turbochargers for all Power Classes - with Innovative Solutions"", ""14_p"": ""Continental’s gasoline turbocharger portfolio caters to all power classes in the automobile segment. Ever since the company entered the market with a turbocharger for the Ford 1.0-liter EcoBoost gasoline engine, it has continued to impress with a steady stream of innovative solutions, including the world’s first turbocharger with aluminum turbine housing for passenger cars. This high-efficiency water-cooled turbocharger made its debut in 2014 in the 1.5-liter three-cylinder gasoline engine for the MINI Hatch. Continental has also demonstrated its expertise in the high-performance segment, where it developed the turbocharger for the 231 horse-power 1.5-liter three-cylinder gasoline engine of the hybrid BMW i8. Newly developed for this model, the turbocharger has an outstanding power-to-weight ratio, can withstand exhaust temperatures of over 1,000 °C and has set new standards with its response under transient load conditions.""}"

It produces short runs of test tires and high-tech tires for luxury-class super sports cars, and tries out new production processes. Continental has invested €45 million in this facility, officially opened in June 2016, creating a total of 80 new jobs. And having built the world's most advanced tire production plant, Continental will now be carrying out some R&D work – traditionally the preserve of Hanover – in Korbach too."", ""13_p"": ""A thoroughbred Continental motorcycle racing tire is used in various classes in Germany's Seriensport races for street-legal machines. Again, Korbach is behind this tire and also developed it at the plant, where the two-wheeler specialists have their own R&D department right next door. Continental’s two-wheeler tires are also in demand in both the original equipment and replacement markets, delivering maximum grip and safety."", ""14_p"": ""Korbach is also home to ContiTech Schlauch which produces under-the-hood and underbody hoses. In the absence of these hoses and manifolds, neither fuel, nor brake fluid nor exhaust gas could move around the car and engine. To do their job, these flexible lines have to be extremely resistant to heat and pressure. Even the quantities involved are amazing – the plant produces over 185,000 meters of hose per day, enough to reach from the factory gates all the way to Cologne. In addition, hoses are produced for the food processing industry, aircraft refuelling and horticulture. Other products include hose bends and parts for connecting the various lines and hoses in cars."", ""15_p"": ""For Korbach's 24,000 or so inhabitants, the plant is the largest employer and, with apprentice numbers currently standing at 146, one of the region's largest training organizations, as well.""}"

A “research department on the shop floor” capable of producing all the necessary tire components with the greatest precision on newly developed machinery has been created in the 12.000 m² production shop. “In addition to producing ultra-high-performance tires to meet the exacting requirements of high-powered sports cars, we will also be building test tires as we develop and trial new manufacturing processes in Korbach,” explains Plant Manager Lothar Salokat. “Using cutting-edge technology, we document every detail of our research and development projects so that our innovations can then be rolled out in Continental tire plants worldwide.” In a first for Continental, all HPTC's machinery is completely networked via sensor systems and software. This approach, which falls under the heading of “Industry 4.0”, allows every step in the process and the behavior of the materials during processing to be fully documented."", ""21_p"": ""“As a result, our tire-building experts, chemists and physicists are able to design cutting-edge processes and monitor every detail of their suitability for industrial-scale tire production,” explains Georg Reichert, HPTC Project Manager in charge of construction in Korbach. “This means that from now on we can carry out even ultra-short production run testing on the conventional tire-making machinery used across Continental. Changes to individual materials and production steps and to vulcanization temperatures and times can be simulated and then their impact on the finished tire can be investigated in vehicle tests.” The “research department on the shop floor” includes everything usually found in a tire-building plant. The rubber compounds required for the individual components are produced absolutely consistently and exactly in line with their recipe; steel cord and textile cutters are available for producing the semi-finished products, as are extruders, various tire-building machines and hot presses for vulcanization. While all the tire-building machines meet Continental's usual standards, individual segments of the green tire can be cured at different temperatures. This kind of “multi-zone” heating can be used for test series, for example, to enable detailed monitoring of the chemical reactions that take place during vulcanization.""}"
