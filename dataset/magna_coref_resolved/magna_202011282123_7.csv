Dynamax is designed to continuously monitor driving conditions and anticipate AWD system requirements, compared to other AWD systems which can only react to conditions after they occur. Dynamax’s intelligent control unit continuously analyzes data from the vehicle controller, and through a multi-plate clutch, the coupling system is fully controllable via an electro-hydraulic actuation system. This Dynamax system behavior is completely transparent to the driver. Other advantages of Dynamax include:
• Improved lateral stability while cornering.
• Removal of unintended over and under steer by reducing unwanted traction forces to
 the front and rear axle.
• High thermal capacity, which helps prevent overheating and subsequent shutdown of the coupling during events such as hill climbing and trailer towing. In addition, greater efficiency is achieved through the intelligent control electronics, providing the torque required for enhanced traction in a variety of driving situations. As a result lower fuel consumption and reduced CO2 emissions are achieved. Furthermore, electronic components are optimally sized for minimal energy usage. Dynamax offers true AWD for drivers who want an exciting driving experience with enhanced safety and performance. Editors’ Notes Kia Motors Europe

 - enhanced accountability of directors as they will be elected or
 removed by public shareholders instead of the current controlling
 shareholder;
 - greater access to capital as investors previously unwilling or unable
 to invest in Magna will become interested, resulting in lower cost of
 capital; and
 - removal of the controlling impediment to potential takeover interest.
 While we acknowledge legitimate corporate governance concerns regarding
the Magna transaction, we believe the potential downside risk of missing this
unexpected opportunity to get rid of the multiple voting shares even at such a

(TSX: MG.A, NYSE: MGA) today announced that it has entered into a transaction agreement with the Stronach Trust under which holders of Magna's Class A subordinate voting shares would be given the opportunity to decide whether to eliminate the dual class share capital structure through which Magna's founder, Frank Stronach, and his family have controlled Magna since the late 1970s. The proposed transaction would also: </P><PRE>    -   set a termination date and declining fee schedule for the consulting,\n        business development and business services contracts Magna has in\n        place with Frank Stronach and his affiliated entities; and\n\n    -   establish a joint venture with the Stronach group to jointly continue\n        to pursue opportunities in the vehicle electrification business.\n\n\n</PRE> <P>The transaction would be effected by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement, and be subject to the approval of a majority of Magna's minority Class A shareholders. &nbsp;</P> <P>\""We believe the proposed transaction, if approved by shareholders, has the potential to unlock significant share value for Magna shareholders and establish a strong foundation for the company's continued and long-term success\"", said <SPAN class=xn-person>Don Walker</SPAN> and <SPAN class=xn-person>Siegfried Wolf</SPAN>, Co-Chief Executive Officers of Magna. \""The proposed transaction is intended to reduce or eliminate the discount at which Magna currently trades relative to its peers, more closely align all shareholder interests, and enhance Magna's potential business opportunity for the electrification of future vehicles.\"" </P> <P><SPAN class=xn-person>Frank Stronach</SPAN>, Magna's Chairman and founder, commented, \""The ability for an entrepreneur to raise growth capital under a multiple voting share structure has enabled <SPAN class=xn-location>Canada</SPAN> to create a number of world-class companies, like Magna. For me, that opportunity occurred in the late 1970s, when I gave up a sizeable portion of my total equity value as part of a shareholder-approved reorganization in exchange for the control that enabled me to establish the principles, culture and entrepreneurial framework that have been the cornerstone of Magna's impressive growth and success over the years.\"" </P> <P>\""While I am content to maintain the status quo, I understand the potential benefits of management's proposal, particularly the opportunity to establish a strong foundation for the future while preserving Magna's unique corporate culture. Accordingly, if the Class A shareholders are supportive of the proposed transaction, the Stronach Trust is prepared to move forward under the proposed new capital structure. If shareholders prefer instead to retain the status quo, I am equally confident that Magna will continue to succeed under its current structure. Regardless of their decision, I have full confidence in our management and employees, and in the operating principles that have served Magna so well and made it the great company that it is today.\"" </P> <P>Investment Community Conference Call </P> <P>Management will discuss the proposed transaction in greater detail on its previously scheduled quarterly earnings conference call, which will be held today at <SPAN class=xn-chron>7:30 am ET</SPAN>. Dial-in and replay instructions are provided at the end of this press release. </P> <P>Terms of the Transaction </P> <P>The transaction agreement is between Magna and the Stronach Trust, which indirectly owns all of the 726,829 outstanding Class B Shares. Because each Class B share carries 300 votes, the Stronach Trust has approximately 66% of Magna's voting rights. </P> <P>If the arrangement is approved by Class A shareholders and the court, Magna would purchase for cancellation all 726,829 Class B Shares and the Stronach Trust would indirectly receive 9 million newly issued Class A Shares and <SPAN class=xn-money>US$300 million</SPAN> in cash. Based on the closing price of Magna's Class A shares on the New York Stock Exchange on <SPAN class=xn-chron>May 5, 2010</SPAN> of <SPAN class=xn-money>US$62.53</SPAN>, the transaction would have a total value of <SPAN class=xn-money>US$863 million</SPAN>. </P> <P>After the transaction, Magna would have approximately 121 million shares outstanding, each of which would carry one vote per share. The shares held indirectly by the Stronach Trust would represent an equal equity ownership and voting interest of 7.44%. In addition, Magna's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation would be amended to remove the Class B Shares from the authorized capital and to make non-substantive consequential changes to its Articles, including renaming the Class A Subordinate Voting Shares as Common Shares and eliminating provisions which no longer apply due to the elimination of the Class B Shares. </P> <P><SPAN class=xn-person>Vincent J. Galifi</SPAN>, Magna's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, stated, \""Magna has historically traded at a discount to its industry peers, despite delivering comparable or better operating and financial performance while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We believe the proposed transaction could reduce or eliminate that discount, broaden Magna's appeal to investors who do not -- as a matter of preference or internal policy -- invest in companies with multiple vote share structures and establish a strong platform for future success. We also believe the proposed joint venture is a good way for Magna to pursue an opportunity that has significant growth potential, but which also bears risk and uncertainty.\"" </P> <P>Amended Consulting Contracts </P> <P>If the arrangement is approved, Magna would amend its existing consulting, business development and business services contracts with Mr. Stronach and his affiliated entities, Stronach &amp; Co. and Stronach Consulting Corp. These contracts are currently renewable on an annual basis. Under the proposed amendments, these contracts would terminate on <SPAN class=xn-chron>December 31, 2014</SPAN> and fees payable prior to that date would be reduced from the current 3% of Magna's Pre-Tax Profits Before Profit Sharing (as defined in the Corporate Constitution) over a transition and phase-out period as follows: </P><PRE>    -   2.75% in 2011,\n    -   2.50% in 2012,\n    -   2.25% in 2013, and\n    -   2.00% in 2014.\n\n\n</PRE> <P>Mr. Stronach's ongoing role and participation on the Board would be subject to the same nomination and election process that applies to all other directors. The current intention of the Board is for Mr. Stronach to continue to serve as Chairman, although he would resign as a member of the Board's nominating committee. </P> <P>Vehicle Electrification Joint Venture </P> <P>The proposed new joint venture would involve the engineering, development and integration of electric vehicles of any type, the development, testing and manufacturing of batteries and battery packs for hybrid (H) and electric vehicles (EV) and all ancillary activities in connection with electric vehicle technologies. Magna would invest <SPAN class=xn-money>$220 million</SPAN> for a 73% interest. Magna's contribution would include the assets of Magna's recently established E-Car Systems vehicle electrification and battery business unit, certain other vehicle electrification assets, and the balance in cash. Among other operations, Magna E-Car includes the Ford battery electric vehicle (BEV) integration program that launches next year. The Stronach group would invest <SPAN class=xn-money>$80 million</SPAN> in cash for a 27% interest in the joint venture and would have effective control through the right to appoint three of five board members, with Magna appointing the remaining two members. </P> <P>Although the joint venture would be free to pursue any type of business activity connected with electric vehicles, Magna would have an unrestricted right to engage in competitive activities outside of the joint venture, and neither party would be obligated to provide any future funding or financial assistance beyond its initial contribution. </P> <P>Next Steps </P> <P>The proposed share capital reorganization would be implemented pursuant to a court-approved plan of arrangement and will require the approval of a majority of the votes cast by minority Class A shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders expected to take place in late June or July of this year. In addition to shareholder and court approvals, the transaction is subject to approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange, the finalization of definitive agreements and customary closing conditions, as well as certain amendments to the consulting agreements through which <SPAN class=xn-person>Frank Stronach</SPAN> and certain of his affiliated entities provide consulting services to the Magna group of companies. </P> <P>The execution of the transaction agreement was approved by Magna's Board of Directors after receiving the report of a Special Committee of independent directors of Magna comprised of Messrs. <SPAN class=xn-person>Michael D. Harris</SPAN>, who acted as Chair of the Committee, <SPAN class=xn-person>Donald Resnick</SPAN> and <SPAN class=xn-person>Louis E. Lataif</SPAN>. The Special Committee received independent legal advice from Fasken Martineau LLP, independent financial advice from CIBC World Markets Inc. and independent valuation advice concerning the E-Car joint venture from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. </P> <P>\""We believe this proposal responds to the concerns Class A shareholders have raised about Magna's multiple voting share structure, and that the decision to proceed or not should be in their hands,\"" said Mr. Harris, Magna's Lead Director. \""If the Class A shareholders do not approve the transaction, Magna will continue to operate under its current structure. Whatever the outcome, Magna's current Board and management remain committed to the culture and operating principles embodied in the Corporate Constitution and Employee Charter.\"" </P> <P>While the Board of Directors did not make a recommendation on how shareholders should vote, various considerations which they believe shareholders should take into account and a summary of the advice received from the independent advisors, as well as the detailed transaction terms, the background to the proposal, the process followed by the independent directors in reviewing the proposal with the benefit of independent legal and financial advisors, and other relevant information will be contained in the proxy materials for the special meeting of shareholders to be called to consider the plan of arrangement. </P> <P>About Magna </P> <P>We are the most diversified global automotive supplier.

(TSX: MG.A, NYSE: MGA) today announced that it has entered into a transaction agreement with the Stronach Trust under which holders of Magna's Class A subordinate voting shares would be given the opportunity to decide whether to eliminate the dual class share capital structure through which Magna's founder, Frank Stronach, and his family have controlled Magna since the late 1970s. The proposed transaction would also: - set a termination date and declining fee schedule for the consulting,
 business development and business services contracts Magna has in
 place with Frank Stronach and his affiliated entities; and
 - establish a joint venture with the Stronach group to jointly continue
 to pursue opportunities in the vehicle electrification business.
 The transaction would be effected by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement, and be subject to the approval of a majority of Magna's minority Class A shareholders. ""We believe the proposed transaction, if approved by shareholders, has the potential to unlock significant share value for Magna shareholders and establish a strong foundation for the company's continued and long-term success"", said Don Walker and Siegfried Wolf, Co-Chief Executive Officers of Magna. ""The proposed transaction is intended to reduce or eliminate the discount at which Magna currently trades relative to its peers, more closely align all shareholder interests, and enhance Magna's potential business opportunity for the electrification of future vehicles."" Frank Stronach, Magna's Chairman and founder, commented, ""The ability for an entrepreneur to raise growth capital under a multiple voting share structure has enabled Canada to create a number of world-class companies, like Magna. For me, that opportunity occurred in the late 1970s, when I gave up a sizeable portion of my total equity value as part of a shareholder-approved reorganization in exchange for the control that enabled me to establish the principles, culture and entrepreneurial framework that have been the cornerstone of Magna's impressive growth and success over the years."" ""While I am content to maintain the status quo, I understand the potential benefits of management's proposal, particularly the opportunity to establish a strong foundation for the future while preserving Magna's unique corporate culture. Accordingly, if the Class A shareholders are supportive of the proposed transaction, the Stronach Trust is prepared to move forward under the proposed new capital structure. If shareholders prefer instead to retain the status quo, I am equally confident that Magna will continue to succeed under its current structure. Regardless of their decision, I have full confidence in our management and employees, and in the operating principles that have served Magna so well and made it the great company that it is today."" Investment Community Conference Call Management will discuss the proposed transaction in greater detail on its previously scheduled quarterly earnings conference call, which will be held today at 7:30 am ET. Dial-in and replay instructions are provided at the end of this press release. Terms of the Transaction The transaction agreement is between Magna and the Stronach Trust, which indirectly owns all of the 726,829 outstanding Class B Shares. Because each Class B share carries 300 votes, the Stronach Trust has approximately 66% of Magna's voting rights. If the arrangement is approved by Class A shareholders and the court, Magna would purchase for cancellation all 726,829 Class B Shares and the Stronach Trust would indirectly receive 9 million newly issued Class A Shares and US$300 million in cash. Based on the closing price of Magna's Class A shares on the New York Stock Exchange on May 5, 2010 of US$62.53, the transaction would have a total value of US$863 million. After the transaction, Magna would have approximately 121 million shares outstanding, each of which would carry one vote per share. The shares held indirectly by the Stronach Trust would represent an equal equity ownership and voting interest of 7.44%. In addition, Magna's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation would be amended to remove the Class B Shares from the authorized capital and to make non-substantive consequential changes to its Articles, including renaming the Class A Subordinate Voting Shares as Common Shares and eliminating provisions which no longer apply due to the elimination of the Class B Shares. Vincent J. Galifi, Magna's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, stated, ""Magna has historically traded at a discount to its industry peers, despite delivering comparable or better operating and financial performance while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We believe the proposed transaction could reduce or eliminate that discount, broaden Magna's appeal to investors who do not -- as a matter of preference or internal policy -- invest in companies with multiple vote share structures and establish a strong platform for future success. We also believe the proposed joint venture is a good way for Magna to pursue an opportunity that has significant growth potential, but which also bears risk and uncertainty."" Amended Consulting Contracts If the arrangement is approved, Magna would amend its existing consulting, business development and business services contracts with Mr. Stronach and his affiliated entities, Stronach & Co. and Stronach Consulting Corp. These contracts are currently renewable on an annual basis. Under the proposed amendments, these contracts would terminate on December 31, 2014 and fees payable prior to that date would be reduced from the current 3% of Magna's Pre-Tax Profits Before Profit Sharing (as defined in the Corporate Constitution) over a transition and phase-out period as follows: - 2.75% in 2011,
 - 2.50% in 2012,
 - 2.25% in 2013, and
 - 2.00% in 2014.
 Mr. Stronach's ongoing role and participation on the Board would be subject to the same nomination and election process that applies to all other directors. The current intention of the Board is for Mr. Stronach to continue to serve as Chairman, although he would resign as a member of the Board's nominating committee. Vehicle Electrification Joint Venture The proposed new joint venture would involve the engineering, development and integration of electric vehicles of any type, the development, testing and manufacturing of batteries and battery packs for hybrid (H) and electric vehicles (EV) and all ancillary activities in connection with electric vehicle technologies. Magna would invest $220 million for a 73% interest. Magna's contribution would include the assets of Magna's recently established E-Car Systems vehicle electrification and battery business unit, certain other vehicle electrification assets, and the balance in cash. Among other operations, Magna E-Car includes the Ford battery electric vehicle (BEV) integration program that launches next year. The Stronach group would invest $80 million in cash for a 27% interest in the joint venture and would have effective control through the right to appoint three of five board members, with Magna appointing the remaining two members. Although the joint venture would be free to pursue any type of business activity connected with electric vehicles, Magna would have an unrestricted right to engage in competitive activities outside of the joint venture, and neither party would be obligated to provide any future funding or financial assistance beyond its initial contribution. Next Steps The proposed share capital reorganization would be implemented pursuant to a court-approved plan of arrangement and will require the approval of a majority of the votes cast by minority Class A shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders expected to take place in late June or July of this year. In addition to shareholder and court approvals, the transaction is subject to approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange, the finalization of definitive agreements and customary closing conditions, as well as certain amendments to the consulting agreements through which Frank Stronach and certain of his affiliated entities provide consulting services to the Magna group of companies. The execution of the transaction agreement was approved by Magna's Board of Directors after receiving the report of a Special Committee of independent directors of Magna comprised of Messrs. Michael D. Harris, who acted as Chair of the Committee, Donald Resnick and Louis E. Lataif. The Special Committee received independent legal advice from Fasken Martineau LLP, independent financial advice from CIBC World Markets Inc. and independent valuation advice concerning the E-Car joint venture from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. ""We believe this proposal responds to the concerns Class A shareholders have raised about Magna's multiple voting share structure, and that the decision to proceed or not should be in their hands,"" said Mr. Harris, Magna's Lead Director. ""If the Class A shareholders do not approve the transaction, Magna will continue to operate under its current structure. Whatever the outcome, Magna's current Board and management remain committed to the culture and operating principles embodied in the Corporate Constitution and Employee Charter."" While the Board of Directors did not make a recommendation on how shareholders should vote, various considerations which they believe shareholders should take into account and a summary of the advice received from the independent advisors, as well as the detailed transaction terms, the background to the proposal, the process followed by the independent directors in reviewing the proposal with the benefit of independent legal and financial advisors, and other relevant information will be contained in the proxy materials for the special meeting of shareholders to be called to consider the plan of arrangement.

We design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced automotive systems, assemblies, modules and components, and engineer and assemble complete vehicles, primarily for sale to original equipment manufacturers (\""OEMs\"") of cars and light trucks. Our capabilities include the design, engineering, testing and manufacture of automotive interior systems; seating systems; closure systems; body and chassis systems; vision systems; electronic systems; exterior systems; powertrain systems; roof systems; hybrid and electric vehicles/systems; as well as complete vehicle engineering and assembly. We follow a corporate policy of functional and operational decentralization, pursuant to which we conduct our operations through divisions, each of which is an autonomous business unit operating within pre-determined guidelines. As at March 31, 2010, we had 240 manufacturing divisions and 76 product development, engineering and sales centres in 25 countries. </p> <p>Our operations are segmented on a geographic basis between North America, Europe and Rest of World (primarily Asia, South America and Africa). A Co-Chief Executive Officer heads management in each of our two primary markets, North America and Europe. The role of the North American and European management teams is to manage our interests to ensure a coordinated effort across our different capabilities. In addition to maintaining key customer, supplier and government contacts in their respective markets, our regional management teams centrally manage key aspects of our operations while permitting our divisions enough flexibility through our decentralized structure to foster an entrepreneurial environment. </p> <p>HIGHLIGHTS</p> <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>We continued to experience a recovery in the automotive industry in the first quarter of 2010, particularly in North America. North American light vehicle production increased 67% in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the extremely low level of production experienced in the first quarter of 2009. Even compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, North American light vehicle production increased 3% in the first quarter of 2010. The key reasons for the increase in North American light vehicle production are the improvement in North American auto sales over the past number of months, combined with low levels of dealer inventories relative to long-term historical averages. </p> <p>In Western Europe, light vehicle production increased 33% over the first quarter of 2009, and 3% over the fourth quarter of 2009. However, while European auto sales have remained strong relative to the North American auto market, they have recently begun to decline from the sales levels experienced in the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect this negative auto sales trend to adversely impact Western European light vehicle production for the remainder of 2010. </p> <p>Our first quarter results largely reflect the significantly improved levels of light vehicle production in our two principal markets, North America and Europe, combined with the benefits of our restructuring, right-sizing and other cost reduction efforts over the past couple of years. Our first quarter 2010 total sales increased 54% over the first quarter of 2009, as North American, European and Rest of World production sales, as well as complete vehicle assembly sales all posted increases, as compared to the first quarter of 2009. Operating income increased $515 million to $285 million, compared to an operating loss of $230 million in the first quarter of 2009. </p> <p>In light of our return to profitability, our Board of Directors reinstated our quarterly dividend, amounting to $0.18 per share in respect of the first quarter of 2010. </p> <p>While we remain cautious about the European automotive market, reflecting the negative impacts of vehicle sales \""pulled forward\"" over the past year, as well as uncertainty about macroeconomic factors impacting a number of European countries recently, we are encouraged by the recovery in automotive sales in a number of other markets, including North America. We are working hard to contain costs and continue to improve capacity utilization, so as to fully benefit from the recovery in vehicle production. </p> <p>FINANCIAL RESULTS SUMMARY</p> <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>During the first quarter of 2010, we posted sales of $5.5 billion, an increase of 54% from the first quarter of 2009. This higher sales level was a result of increases in our North American, European and Rest of World production sales, and complete vehicle assembly sales offset in part by a decrease in tooling, engineering and other sales. Comparing the first quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2009: </p> <pre>    \n    -   North American vehicle production increased by 67% and average dollar\n        content per vehicle increased 5%;\n    -   European vehicle production increased 33% and average dollar content\n        per vehicle increased 15%; and\n    -   Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 11% to $446 million from\n        $401 million, as complete vehicle assembly volumes increased 49%.\n    \n</pre> <p>During the first quarter of 2010, we generated operating income of $285 million compared to an operating loss of $230 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the first quarter of 2010, as discussed in the \""Unusual Items\"" section, the $501 million increase in operating income was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, operating income was positively impacted by: </p> <pre>    \n    -   lower costs associated with restructuring and downsizing activities;\n    -   the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost\n        saving initiatives undertaken during or subsequent to the first\n        quarter of 2009;\n    -   productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;\n    -   incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence\n        Innovation s.r.o, (\""Cadence\""); and\n    -   the sale of certain underperforming divisions during or subsequent to\n        the first quarter of 2009.\n    \n</pre> <p>These factors were partially offset by: </p> <pre>    \n    -   higher costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches or for\n        programs that have not fully ramped up production;\n    -   employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;\n    -   higher incentive compensation;\n    -   higher electric vehicle development costs;\n    -   higher costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics\n        capabilities;\n    -   higher executive compensation; and\n    -   net customer price concessions subsequent to the first quarter of\n        2009.\n    \n</pre> <p>During the first quarter of 2010, net income was $223 million compared to a net loss of $200 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the first quarter of 2010, as discussed in the \""Unusual Items\"" section, net income for 2010 increased $409 million. The increase in net income was a result of the increase in operating income partially offset by higher income taxes. </p> <p>During the first quarter of 2010, our diluted earnings per share were $1.97 compared to diluted loss per share of $1.79 for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the first quarter of 2010, as discussed in the \""Unusual Items\"" section, diluted earnings per share for 2010 increased $3.64. The increase in diluted earnings per share is as a result of the increase in net income, excluding unusual items, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the first quarter of 2010. The increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to an increase in the number of diluted shares associated with restricted stock and stock options since such shares were anti-dilutive in the first quarter of 2009. </p> <p>UNUSUAL ITEMS</p> <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>During the first quarter of 2010, we sold an electronics systems facility in China and realized a $14 million ($14 million after tax) gain. This gain contributed $0.12 to our diluted earnings per share. There were no unusual items in the first quarter of 2009. </p> <p>INDUSTRY TRENDS AND RISKS</p> <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Our success is primarily dependent upon the levels of North American and European car and light truck production by our customers and the relative amount of content we have on the various programs. OEM production volumes in different regions may be impacted by factors which may vary from one region to the next, including but not limited to general economic and political conditions, interest rates, credit availability, energy and fuel prices, international conflicts, labour relations issues, regulatory requirements, trade agreements, infrastructure, legislative changes, and environmental emissions and safety issues. These factors and a number of other economic, industry and risk factors which also affect our success, including such things as relative currency values, commodities prices, price reduction pressures from our customers, the financial condition of our supply base and competition from manufacturers with operations in low cost countries, are discussed in our Annual Information Form and Annual Report on Form 40-F, each in respect of the year ended December 31, 2009, and remain substantially unchanged in respect of the first quarter ended March 31, 2010. </p> <p>RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</p> <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <pre>    Average Foreign Exchange\n                                          For the three months\n                                             ended March 31,\n                                          ---------------------\n                                            2010          2009        Change\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    1 Canadian dollar equals U.S. dollars  0.961         0.802        +  20%\n    1 euro equals U.S. dollars             1.384         1.302        +   6%\n    1 British pound equals U.S. dollars    1.562         1.434        +   9%\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \n</pre> <p>The preceding table reflects the average foreign exchange rates between the most common currencies in which we conduct business and our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The significant changes in these foreign exchange rates for the three months ended March 31, 2010 impacted the reported U.S. dollar amounts of our sales, expenses and income. </p> <p>The results of operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates in the table above for the relevant period. Throughout this MD&amp;A, reference is made to the impact of translation of foreign operations on reported U.S. dollar amounts where relevant. </p> <p>Our results can also be affected by the impact of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency transactions (such as raw material purchases or sales denominated in foreign currencies). However, as a result of hedging programs employed by us, foreign currency transactions in the current period have not been fully impacted by movements in exchange rates. We record foreign currency transactions at the hedged rate where applicable. </p> <p>Finally, holding gains and losses on foreign currency denominated monetary items, which are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, impact reported results. </p> <p>Sales</p> <pre>                                          For the three months\n                                             ended March 31,\n                                          ---------------------\n                                            2010          2009        Change\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Vehicle Production Volumes\n     (millions of units)\n      North America                        2.879         1.728        +  67%\n      Europe                               3.380         2.537        +  33%\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Average Dollar Content Per Vehicle\n      North America                    $     953     $     909        +   5%\n      Europe                           $     521     $     454        +  15%\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Sales\n      External Production\n        North America                  $   2,743     $   1,571        +  75%\n        Europe                             1,761         1,152        +  53%\n        Rest of World                        229           108        + 112%\n      Complete Vehicle Assembly              446           401        +  11%\n      Tooling, Engineering and Other         333           342        -   3%\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Total Sales                        $   5,512     $   3,574        +  54%\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \n</pre> <p>External Production Sales - North America </p> <p>External production sales in North America increased 75% or $1.17 billion to $2.74 billion for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $1.57 billion for the first quarter of 2009.

Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, our average dollar content per vehicle decreased primarily as a result of: </p> <pre>    \n    -   unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content\n        on certain programs, including the:\n        -  GM full-sized pickups and SUV's;\n        -  BMW X5;\n        -  Ford F-Series and Lincoln Mark LT;\n        -  Dodge Ram;\n        -  BMW X6/Hybrid; and\n        -  Mercedes-Benz R-Class, M-Class and GL-Class;\n    -   programs that ended production during or subsequent to the first\n        quarter of 2009, including the Pontiac G5 and G6; and\n    -   net customer price concessions subsequent to the first quarter of\n        2009.\n    \n</pre> <p>These factors were partially offset by: </p> <pre>   \n    -   favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content\n        on certain programs, including the:\n        -  Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan and Lincoln MKZ;\n        -  Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave;\n        -  Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX;\n        -  Chevrolet Cobalt;\n        -  Dodge Journey;\n        -  Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town &amp; Country and Volkswagen\n           Routan; and\n        -  Ford Flex;\n    -   the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the first quarter\n        of 2009, including the:\n        -  Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain;\n        -  Cadillac SRX; and\n        -  Chevrolet Camaro; and\n    -   the acquisition of several facilities from Meridian Automotive\n        Systems Inc in the second quarter of 2009.\n    \n</pre> <p>External Production Sales - Europe </p> <p>External production sales in Europe increased 53% or $609 million to $1.76 billion for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $1.15 billion for the first quarter of 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 33% increase in European vehicle production volumes combined with a 15% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. </p> <p>Our average dollar content per vehicle increased by 15% or $67 to $521 for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $454 for the first quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: </p> <pre>    \n    -   acquisitions completed subsequent to the first quarter of 2009,\n        including Cadence;\n    -   an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening of\n        the euro and British pound, each against the U.S. dollar; and\n    -   the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the first\n        quarter of 2009, including the:\n        -  Porsche Panamera;\n        -  Opel Astra;\n        -  Mercedes-Benz E-Class; and\n        -  Audi A5.\n    \n</pre> <p>These factors were partially offset by: </p> <pre>   \n    -   unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content\n        on certain programs, including the:\n        -  smart fortwo;\n        -  MINI Cooper; and\n        -  BMW 3-Series;\n    -   programs that ended production during or subsequent to the first\n        quarter of 2009; and\n    -   net customer price concessions subsequent to the first quarter of\n        2009.\n    \n</pre> <p>External Production Sales - Rest of World </p> <p>External production sales in Rest of World increased 112% or $121 million to $229 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $108 million for the first quarter of 2009. The increase in production sales is primarily as a result of: </p> <pre>   \n    -   increased production and/or content on certain programs in China,\n        Korea and Brazil;\n    -   the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the first quarter\n        of 2009 in China and Japan; and\n    -   an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales as a result of the\n        strengthening of the Brazilian real and Korean won, each against the\n        U.S. dollar.\n    \n</pre> <p>Complete Vehicle Assembly Sales </p> <p>The terms of our various vehicle assembly contracts differ with respect to the ownership of components and supplies related to the assembly process and the method of determining the selling price to the OEM customer. Under certain contracts we are acting as principal and purchased components and systems in assembled vehicles are included in our inventory and cost of goods sold. These costs are reflected on a full-cost basis in the selling price of the final assembled vehicle to the OEM customer. Other contracts provide that third party components and systems are held on consignment by us, and the selling price to the OEM customer reflects a value added assembly fee only. </p> <p>Production levels of the various vehicles assembled by us have an impact on the level of our sales and profitability. In addition, the relative proportion of programs accounted for on a full-cost basis and programs accounted for on a value-added basis, also impacts our level of sales and operating margin percentage, but may not necessarily affect our overall level of profitability. Assuming no change in total vehicles assembled, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a full-cost basis has the effect of increasing the level of total sales, however, because purchased components are included in cost of goods sold, profitability as a percentage of total sales is reduced.

The proposed transaction would also: (i) set a termination date and declining fee schedule for the consulting, business development and business services contracts we have in place with Frank Stronach and his affiliated entities; and (ii) establish a joint venture with the Stronach group to jointly continue to pursue opportunities in the vehicle electrification business. </p> <p>(a) Terms of the Transaction</p> <p>If the arrangement is approved by Class A shareholders and the court, we would purchase for cancellation all 726,829 Class B Shares and, the Stronach Trust would indirectly receive 9.0 million newly issued Class A Shares and $300 million in cash. After the transaction, we would have 121.0 million shares outstanding, each of which would carry one vote. The shares held indirectly by the Stronach Trust would represent an equal equity ownership and voting interest of 7.4%. In addition, Magna's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation would be amended to remove the Class B Shares from the authorized capital and to make non-substantive consequential changes to our Articles, including renaming the Class A Subordinate Voting Shares as Common Shares and eliminating provisions which no longer apply due to the elimination of the Class B Shares.</p> <p>(b) Vehicle Electrification Joint Venture</p> <p>The proposed new joint venture would involve the engineering, development and integration of electric vehicles of any type, the development, testing and manufacturing of batteries and battery packs for hybrid (H) and electric vehicles (EV) and all ancillary activities in connection with electric vehicle technologies. We would invest $220 million for a 73% interest. Our contribution would include the assets of our recently established E-Car Systems vehicle electrification and battery business unit, certain other vehicle electrification assets, and the balance in cash. The Stronach group would invest $80 million in cash for a 27% interest in the joint venture and would have effective control through the right to appoint three of five board members. </p> <p>The proposed share capital reorganization would be implemented pursuant to a court-approved plan of arrangement and will require the approval of a majority of the votes cast by minority Class A shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders expected to take place in late June or July of this year. In addition to shareholder and court approvals, the transaction is subject to approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange, the finalization of definitive agreements and customary closing conditions, as well as certain amendments to the consulting agreements through which Frank Stronach, and certain of his affiliated entities provide consulting services to the Magna group of companies. </p> <p>The execution of the transaction agreement was approved by our Board of Directors after receiving the report of a Special Committee of independent directors of Magna. </p> <p>COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES</p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p> <p>From time to time, we may be contingently liable for litigation and other claims. </p> <p>Refer to note 24 of our 2009 audited consolidated financial statements, which describes these claims. </p> <p>For a discussion of risk factors relating to legal and other claims against us, refer to page 35 of our Annual Information Form and Annual Report on Form 40-F, each in respect of the year ended December 31, 2009. </p> <p>CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES</p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p> <p>There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. </p> <p>FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS</p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p> <p>The previous discussion contains statements that constitute \""forward-looking statements\"" within the meaning of applicable securities legislation, including, but not limited to, statements relating to: European automobile sales and light vehicle production; and the timing of new program launches. The forward-looking information in this document is presented for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward-looking statements may include financial and other projections, as well as statements regarding our future plans, objectives or economic performance, or the assumptions underlying any of the foregoing, and other statements that are not recitations of historical fact. We use words such as \""may\"", \""would\"", \""could\"", \""should\"", \""will\"", \""likely\"", \""expect\"", \""anticipate\"", \""believe\"", \""intend\"", \""plan\"", \""forecast\"", \""outlook\"", \""project\"", \""estimate\"" and similar expressions suggesting future outcomes or events to identify forward-looking statements. Any such forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and are based on assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and our perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors we believe are appropriate in the circumstances. However, whether actual results and developments will conform with our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks, assumptions and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and the effects of which can be difficult to predict, including, without limitation: the potential for a slower than anticipated economic recovery or a deterioration of economic conditions; production volumes and sales levels which are below forecast levels; our dependence on outsourcing by our customers; the termination or non renewal by our customers of any material contracts; our ability to identify and successfully exploit shifts in technology; restructuring, downsizing and/or other significant non-recurring costs; impairment charges; our ability to successfully grow our sales to non-traditional customers; unfavourable product or customer mix; risks of conducting business in foreign countries, including China, India, Brazil, Russia and other developing markets; our ability to quickly shift our manufacturing footprint to take advantage of lower cost manufacturing opportunities; disruptions in the capital and credit markets; fluctuations in relative currency values; our ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions; pricing pressures, including our ability to offset price concessions demanded by our customers; warranty and recall costs; the financial condition and credit worthiness of some of our OEM customers, including the potential that such customers may not make, or may seek to delay or reduce, payments owed to us; the financial condition of some of our suppliers and the risk of their insolvency, bankruptcy or financial restructuring; the highly competitive nature of the automotive parts supply business; product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage; changes in our mix of earnings between jurisdictions with lower tax rates and those with higher tax rates, as well as our ability to fully benefit tax losses; other potential tax exposures; legal claims against us; work stoppages and labour relations disputes; changes in laws and governmental regulations; costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations; potential conflicts of interest involving our indirect controlling shareholder, the Stronach Trust; and other factors set out in our Annual Information Form filed with securities commissions in Canada and our annual report on Form 40-F filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and subsequent filings. In evaluating forward-looking statements, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements and readers should specifically consider the various factors which could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION</p> <p>The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Magna International Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively \""Magna\"" or the \""Company\"") have been prepared in United States dollars following Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (\""GAAP\"") with respect to the preparation of interim financial information.

Accordingly, these estimated fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The estimated fair value amounts can be materially affected by the use of different assumptions or methodologies. The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments are described below:</p> <p>Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, bank indebtedness, accounts payable, accrued salaries and wages, other accrued liabilities and income taxes payable.</p> <p>Due to the short period to maturity of the instruments, the carrying values as presented in the consolidated balance sheets are reasonable estimates of fair values.</p> <p>Investments</p> <p>At March 31, 2010, the Company held Canadian third party asset- backed commercial paper (\""ABCP\"") with a face value of Cdn$127 million (December 31, 2009 - Cdn$134 million). The carrying value and estimated fair value of this investment was Cdn$84 million (December 31, 2009 - Cdn$88 million). As fair value information is not readily determinable for the Company's investment in ABCP, the fair value was based on a valuation technique estimating the fair value from the perspective of a market participant. During the quarter, the Company sold notes for approximately Cdn$4 million, which approximated their carrying value.</p> <p>Term debt</p> <p>The Company's term debt includes $14 million due within one year. Due to the short period to maturity of this debt, the carrying value as presented in the consolidated balance sheet is a reasonable estimate of its fair value.</p> <p>(c) Credit risk</p> <p>The Company's financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, held to maturity investments, and foreign exchange forward contracts with positive fair values.</p> <p>The Company's held for trading investments include an investment in ABCP. Given the continuing uncertainties regarding the value of the underlying assets, the amount and timing over cash flows and the risk of collateral calls in the event that spreads widened considerably, the Company could be exposed to further losses on its investment.</p> <p>Cash and cash equivalents, which consists of short-term investments, are only invested in governments, bank term deposits and bank commercial paper with an investment grade credit rating. Credit risk is further reduced by limiting the amount which is invested in certain governments or any major financial institution.</p> <p>The Company is also exposed to credit risk from the potential default by any of its counterparties on its foreign exchange forward contracts. The Company mitigates this credit risk by dealing with counterparties who are major financial institutions that the Company anticipates will satisfy their obligations under the contracts.</p> <p>In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to credit risk from its customers, substantially all of which are in the automotive industry and are subject to credit risks associated with the automotive industry. Sales to the Company's six largest customers represented 81% of the Company's total sales and substantially all of our sales are to customers in which the Company has ongoing contractual relationships.</p> <p>(d) Currency risk</p> <p>The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates when manufacturing facilities have committed to the delivery of products for which the selling price has been quoted in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency, or when materials and equipment are purchased in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency. In an effort to manage this net foreign exchange exposure, the Company employs hedging programs, primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts.</p> <p>As at March 31, 2010, the net foreign exchange exposure was not material.</p> <p>(e) Interest rate risk</p> <p>The Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk due to the short-term maturity of its monetary current assets and current liabilities. In particular, the amount of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents is impacted more by the investment decisions made and the demands to have available cash on hand, than by movements in the interest rates over a given period.</p> <p>In addition, the Company is not exposed to interest rate risk on its long-term debt instruments as the interest rates on these instruments are fixed.</p> <p>12.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT</p> <p>On May 6, 2010, the Company entered into a transaction agreement with the Stronach Trust under which holders of Magna's Class A subordinate voting shares would be given the opportunity to decide whether to eliminate the dual class share capital structure. The proposed transaction would also: (i) set a termination date and declining fee schedule for the consulting, business development and business services contracts Magna has in place with Frank Stronach and his affiliated entities; and (ii) establish a joint venture with the Stronach group to jointly continue to pursue opportunities in the vehicle electrification business.</p> <p>(a) Terms of the Transaction</p> <p>If the arrangement is approved by Class A shareholders and the court, Magna would purchase for cancellation all 726,829 Class B Shares and, the Stronach Trust would indirectly receive 9.0 million newly issued Class A Shares and $300 million in cash. After the transaction, Magna would have 121.0 million shares outstanding, each of which would carry one vote. The shares held indirectly by the Stronach Trust would represent an equal equity ownership and voting interest of 7.4%. In addition, Magna's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation would be amended to remove the Class B Shares from the authorized capital and to make non-substantive consequential changes to its Articles, including renaming the Class A Subordinate Voting Shares as Common Shares and eliminating provisions which no longer apply due to the elimination of the Class B Shares.</p> <p>(b) Vehicle Electrification Joint Venture</p> <p>The proposed new joint venture would involve the engineering, development and integration of electric vehicles of any type, the development, testing and manufacturing of batteries and battery packs for hybrid (H) and electric vehicles (EV) and all ancillary activities in connection with electric vehicle technologies. Magna would invest $220 million for a 73% interest. Magna's contribution would include the assets of Magna's recently established E-Car Systems vehicle electrification and battery business unit, certain other vehicle electrification assets, and the balance in cash. The Stronach group would invest $80 million in cash for a 27% interest in the joint venture and would have effective control through the right to appoint three of five board members.</p> <p>The proposed share capital reorganization would be implemented pursuant to a court-approved plan of arrangement and will require the approval of a majority of the votes cast by minority Class A shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders expected to take place in late June or July of this year. In addition to shareholder and court approvals, the transaction is subject to approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange, the finalization of definitive agreements and customary closing conditions, as well as certain amendments to the consulting agreements through which Frank Stronach, and certain of his affiliated entities provide consulting services to the Magna group of companies.</p> <p>The execution of the transaction agreement was approved by Magna's Board of Directors after receiving the report of a Special Committee of independent directors of Magna.</p> <p>14.

The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2010 have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") with respect to the preparation of interim financial information and the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009 have been prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP. This MD&A has been prepared as at May 6, 2010. OVERVIEW ------------------------------------------------------------------------- We are the most diversified global automotive supplier. We design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced automotive systems, assemblies, modules and components, and engineer and assemble complete vehicles, primarily for sale to original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"") of cars and light trucks. Our capabilities include the design, engineering, testing and manufacture of automotive interior systems; seating systems; closure systems; body and chassis systems; vision systems; electronic systems; exterior systems; powertrain systems; roof systems; hybrid and electric vehicles/systems; as well as complete vehicle engineering and assembly. We follow a corporate policy of functional and operational decentralization, pursuant to which we conduct our operations through divisions, each of which is an autonomous business unit operating within pre-determined guidelines. As at March 31, 2010, we had 240 manufacturing divisions and 76 product development, engineering and sales centres in 25 countries. Our operations are segmented on a geographic basis between North America, Europe and Rest of World (primarily Asia, South America and Africa). A Co-Chief Executive Officer heads management in each of our two primary markets, North America and Europe. The role of the North American and European management teams is to manage our interests to ensure a coordinated effort across our different capabilities. In addition to maintaining key customer, supplier and government contacts in their respective markets, our regional management teams centrally manage key aspects of our operations while permitting our divisions enough flexibility through our decentralized structure to foster an entrepreneurial environment. HIGHLIGHTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- We continued to experience a recovery in the automotive industry in the first quarter of 2010, particularly in North America. North American light vehicle production increased 67% in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the extremely low level of production experienced in the first quarter of 2009. Even compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, North American light vehicle production increased 3% in the first quarter of 2010. The key reasons for the increase in North American light vehicle production are the improvement in North American auto sales over the past number of months, combined with low levels of dealer inventories relative to long-term historical averages. In Western Europe, light vehicle production increased 33% over the first quarter of 2009, and 3% over the fourth quarter of 2009. However, while European auto sales have remained strong relative to the North American auto market, they have recently begun to decline from the sales levels experienced in the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect this negative auto sales trend to adversely impact Western European light vehicle production for the remainder of 2010. Our first quarter results largely reflect the significantly improved levels of light vehicle production in our two principal markets, North America and Europe, combined with the benefits of our restructuring, right-sizing and other cost reduction efforts over the past couple of years. Our first quarter 2010 total sales increased 54% over the first quarter of 2009, as North American, European and Rest of World production sales, as well as complete vehicle assembly sales all posted increases, as compared to the first quarter of 2009. Operating income increased $515 million to $285 million, compared to an operating loss of $230 million in the first quarter of 2009. In light of our return to profitability, our Board of Directors reinstated our quarterly dividend, amounting to $0.18 per share in respect of the first quarter of 2010. While we remain cautious about the European automotive market, reflecting the negative impacts of vehicle sales ""pulled forward"" over the past year, as well as uncertainty about macroeconomic factors impacting a number of European countries recently, we are encouraged by the recovery in automotive sales in a number of other markets, including North America. We are working hard to contain costs and continue to improve capacity utilization, so as to fully benefit from the recovery in vehicle production. FINANCIAL RESULTS SUMMARY ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the first quarter of 2010, we posted sales of $5.5 billion, an increase of 54% from the first quarter of 2009. This higher sales level was a result of increases in our North American, European and Rest of World production sales, and complete vehicle assembly sales offset in part by a decrease in tooling, engineering and other sales. Comparing the first quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2009: 
 - North American vehicle production increased by 67% and average dollar
 content per vehicle increased 5%;
 - European vehicle production increased 33% and average dollar content
 per vehicle increased 15%; and
 - Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 11% to $446 million from
 $401 million, as complete vehicle assembly volumes increased 49%.
 
 During the first quarter of 2010, we generated operating income of $285 million compared to an operating loss of $230 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the first quarter of 2010, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $501 million increase in operating income was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, operating income was positively impacted by: 
 - lower costs associated with restructuring and downsizing activities;
 - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives undertaken during or subsequent to the first
 quarter of 2009;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence
 Innovation s.r.o, (""Cadence""); and
 - the sale of certain underperforming divisions during or subsequent to
 the first quarter of 2009.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - higher costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches or for
 programs that have not fully ramped up production;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - higher electric vehicle development costs;
 - higher costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics
 capabilities;
 - higher executive compensation; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the first quarter of
 2009.
 
 During the first quarter of 2010, net income was $223 million compared to a net loss of $200 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the first quarter of 2010, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income for 2010 increased $409 million. The increase in net income was a result of the increase in operating income partially offset by higher income taxes. During the first quarter of 2010, our diluted earnings per share were $1.97 compared to diluted loss per share of $1.79 for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the first quarter of 2010, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, diluted earnings per share for 2010 increased $3.64. The increase in diluted earnings per share is as a result of the increase in net income, excluding unusual items, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the first quarter of 2010. The increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to an increase in the number of diluted shares associated with restricted stock and stock options since such shares were anti-dilutive in the first quarter of 2009. UNUSUAL ITEMS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the first quarter of 2010, we sold an electronics systems facility in China and realized a $14 million ($14 million after tax) gain. This gain contributed $0.12 to our diluted earnings per share. There were no unusual items in the first quarter of 2009. INDUSTRY TRENDS AND RISKS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our success is primarily dependent upon the levels of North American and European car and light truck production by our customers and the relative amount of content we have on the various programs. OEM production volumes in different regions may be impacted by factors which may vary from one region to the next, including but not limited to general economic and political conditions, interest rates, credit availability, energy and fuel prices, international conflicts, labour relations issues, regulatory requirements, trade agreements, infrastructure, legislative changes, and environmental emissions and safety issues. These factors and a number of other economic, industry and risk factors which also affect our success, including such things as relative currency values, commodities prices, price reduction pressures from our customers, the financial condition of our supply base and competition from manufacturers with operations in low cost countries, are discussed in our Annual Information Form and Annual Report on Form 40-F, each in respect of the year ended December 31, 2009, and remain substantially unchanged in respect of the first quarter ended March 31, 2010.

 The preceding table reflects the average foreign exchange rates between the most common currencies in which we conduct business and our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The significant changes in these foreign exchange rates for the three months ended March 31, 2010 impacted the reported U.S. dollar amounts of our sales, expenses and income. The results of operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates in the table above for the relevant period. Throughout this MD&A, reference is made to the impact of translation of foreign operations on reported U.S. dollar amounts where relevant. Our results can also be affected by the impact of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency transactions (such as raw material purchases or sales denominated in foreign currencies). However, as a result of hedging programs employed by us, foreign currency transactions in the current period have not been fully impacted by movements in exchange rates. We record foreign currency transactions at the hedged rate where applicable. Finally, holding gains and losses on foreign currency denominated monetary items, which are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, impact reported results.

 External Production Sales - North America External production sales in North America increased 75% or $1.17 billion to $2.74 billion for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $1.57 billion for the first quarter of 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 67% increase in North American vehicle production volumes combined with a 5% increase in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. Our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 5% or $44 to $953 for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $909 for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, our average dollar content per vehicle decreased primarily as a result of: 
 - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - GM full-sized pickups and SUV's;
 - BMW X5;
 - Ford F-Series and Lincoln Mark LT;
 - Dodge Ram;
 - BMW X6/Hybrid; and
 - Mercedes-Benz R-Class, M-Class and GL-Class;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the first
 quarter of 2009, including the Pontiac G5 and G6; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the first quarter of
 2009.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan and Lincoln MKZ;
 - Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave;
 - Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX;
 - Chevrolet Cobalt;
 - Dodge Journey;
 - Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and Volkswagen
 Routan; and
 - Ford Flex;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the first quarter
 of 2009, including the:
 - Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain;
 - Cadillac SRX; and
 - Chevrolet Camaro; and
 - the acquisition of several facilities from Meridian Automotive
 Systems Inc in the second quarter of 2009.
 
 External Production Sales - Europe External production sales in Europe increased 53% or $609 million to $1.76 billion for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $1.15 billion for the first quarter of 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 33% increase in European vehicle production volumes combined with a 15% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. Our average dollar content per vehicle increased by 15% or $67 to $521 for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $454 for the first quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: 
 - acquisitions completed subsequent to the first quarter of 2009,
 including Cadence;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening of
 the euro and British pound, each against the U.S. dollar; and
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the first
 quarter of 2009, including the:
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Opel Astra;
 - Mercedes-Benz E-Class; and
 - Audi A5.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - smart fortwo;
 - MINI Cooper; and
 - BMW 3-Series;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the first
 quarter of 2009; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the first quarter of
 2009.
 
 External Production Sales - Rest of World External production sales in Rest of World increased 112% or $121 million to $229 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $108 million for the first quarter of 2009. The increase in production sales is primarily as a result of: 
 - increased production and/or content on certain programs in China,
 Korea and Brazil;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the first quarter
 of 2009 in China and Japan; and
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales as a result of the
 strengthening of the Brazilian real and Korean won, each against the
 U.S. dollar.
 
 Complete Vehicle Assembly Sales The terms of our various vehicle assembly contracts differ with respect to the ownership of components and supplies related to the assembly process and the method of determining the selling price to the OEM customer. Under certain contracts we are acting as principal and purchased components and systems in assembled vehicles are included in our inventory and cost of goods sold. These costs are reflected on a full-cost basis in the selling price of the final assembled vehicle to the OEM customer. Other contracts provide that third party components and systems are held on consignment by us, and the selling price to the OEM customer reflects a value added assembly fee only. Production levels of the various vehicles assembled by us have an impact on the level of our sales and profitability. In addition, the relative proportion of programs accounted for on a full-cost basis and programs accounted for on a value-added basis, also impacts our level of sales and operating margin percentage, but may not necessarily affect our overall level of profitability. Assuming no change in total vehicles assembled, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a full-cost basis has the effect of increasing the level of total sales, however, because purchased components are included in cost of goods sold, profitability as a percentage of total sales is reduced. Conversely, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a value-added basis has the effect of reducing the level of total sales and increasing profitability as a percentage of total sales.

 Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 11% or $45 million to $446 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $401 million for the first quarter of 2009 while assembly volumes increased 49% or 5,928 units. The increase in complete vehicle assembly sales is primarily as a result of: 
 - the launch of new assembly programs subsequent to the first quarter
 of 2009, including the Peugeot RCZ and the Aston Martin Rapide;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening of
 the euro against the U.S. dollar; and
 - an increase in assembly volumes for the BMW X3, Chrysler 300 and Jeep
 Grand Cherokee.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - the end of production of the Saab 9(3) Convertible in the fourth
 quarter of 2009; and
 - lower assembly volumes for the Mercedes-Benz G-Class.
 
 In addition, several new complete vehicle assembly programs have been awarded that are scheduled to launch at various times between 2010 and 2013. Tooling, Engineering and Other Sales Tooling, engineering and other sales decreased 3% or $9 million to $333 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $342 million for the first quarter of 2009. In the first quarter of 2010 the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: 
 - Chevrolet Silverado;
 - BMW X3;
 - Audi A8;
 - Mercedes-Benz R-Class;
 - Porsche Cayenne;
 - MINI Cooper and Crossman;
 - Opel/Vauxhall Astra;
 - Jeep Grand Cherokee; and
 - Mercedes-Benz E-Class.
 
 In the first quarter of 2009 the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: 
 - Chevrolet Silverado;
 - MINI Crossman;
 - Cadillac SRX and Saab 9-4X;
 - Chevrolet Equinox and Suzuki XL7;
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - BMW X3;
 - Ford Taurus;
 - Hummer H3; and
 - Cadillac DTS and Cadillac CTS.
 
 In addition, tooling, engineering and other sales increased as a result of the strengthening of the euro and Canadian dollar, each against the U.S. dollar. Gross Margin Gross margin increased $498 million to $742 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $244 million for the first quarter of 2009 and gross margin as a percentage of total sales increased to 13.5% for the first quarter of 2010 compared to 6.8% for the first quarter of 2009. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of total sales was substantially due to increased gross margin earned as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, gross margin as a percentage of total sales was positively impacted by: 
 - lower costs associated with restructuring and downsizing activities;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives that were undertaken during or subsequent to the
 first quarter of 2009;
 - acquisitions completed subsequent to the first quarter of 2009; and
 - a decrease in tooling sales that earn low or no margins.
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - higher costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches, primarily
 in Europe;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher electric vehicle development costs;
 - higher costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics
 capabilities;
 - an increase in complete vehicle assembly sales which have a lower
 gross margin than our consolidated average; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the first quarter of
 2009.
 
 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization costs decreased 2% or $4 million to $165 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $169 million for the first quarter of 2009. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily as a result of: 
 - the impairment of certain assets subsequent to the first quarter of
 2009; and
 - the sale or disposition of certain facilities subsequent to the first
 quarter of 2009.
 
 These factors were partially offset by 
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar depreciation and amortization due
 to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and euro, each against
 the U.S. dollar; and
 - acquisitions completed subsequent to the first quarter of 2009.
 
 Selling, General and Administrative (""SG&A"") SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 5.5% for the first quarter of 2010 compared to 8.4% for the first quarter of 2009. The unusual item discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section positively impacted SG&A as a percentage of total sales in the first quarter of 2010 by 0.2%. Excluding this unusual item, SG&A as a percentage of total sales decreased by 2.7%. SG&A expense decreased $1 million to $301 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $302 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the $14 million unusual item recorded in the first quarter of 2010 (as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section), SG&A expenses increased by $13 million primarily as a result of: 
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar SG&A expense due to the
 strengthening of the Canadian dollar and euro, each against the U.S.
 dollar;
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - higher executive compensation; and
 - acquisitions completed subsequent to the first quarter of 2009.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - cost saving initiatives, including reduced discretionary spending,
 employee reductions and benefit plan changes;
 - lower costs associated with restructuring and downsizing activities;
 and
 - the sale or disposition of certain facilities during or subsequent to
 the first quarter of 2009.

 North America EBIT in North America increased $343 million to earnings of $254 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $89 million for the first quarter of 2009 substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: 
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - lower costs associated with restructuring and downsizing activities;
 and
 - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives undertaken during or subsequent to the first
 quarter of 2009.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - higher affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher electric vehicle development costs;
 - higher costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the first quarter of
 2009.
 
 Europe EBIT in Europe increased $113 million to a loss of $6 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $119 million for the first quarter of 2009 substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: 
 - lower costs associated with restructuring and downsizing activities;
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence;
 - the sale of certain underperforming divisions during or subsequent to
 the first quarter of 2009;
 - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives undertaken during or subsequent to the first
 quarter of 2009; and
 - lower commodity costs.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - higher costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches or for
 programs that have not fully ramped up production;
 - higher costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics
 capabilities;
 - higher affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - higher warranty costs;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the first quarter of
 2009.
 
 Rest of World Rest of World EBIT increased $30 million to $29 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $1 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the Rest of World unusual item discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $16 million increase in EBIT was primarily as a result of: 
 - additional margin earned on increased production sales; and
 - incremental margin earned on new programs that launched during or
 subsequent to the first quarter of 2009.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - higher launch costs incurred, primarily in Japan; and
 - a decrease in equity income earned.
 
 Corporate and Other Corporate and Other EBIT increased $23 million to $5 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $18 million for the first quarter of 2009 primarily as a result of: 
 - an increase in affiliation fees earned from our divisions; and
 - an increase in equity income earned.
 
 These factors were partially offset by increased executive compensation. Interest (Income) Expense, net During the first quarter of 2010, we recorded net interest income of $3 million, compared to $3 million of net interest expense for the first quarter of 2009. The $6 million increase in net interest income is as a result of a reduction in interest expense due to the repayment of our 7.08% Subordinated Debentures and our 6.5% Convertible Subordinated Debenture subsequent to the first quarter of 2009. Operating Income (Loss) Operating income increased $515 million to $285 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $230 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual item discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, operating income for the first quarter of 2010 increased $501 million. The increase in operating income is the result of the increase in EBIT and the increase in net interest income earned, both as discussed above. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate on operating income (excluding equity income) increased to 22.2% for the first quarter of 2010 compared to 13.0% for the first quarter of 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, income tax rates were impacted by the unusual item discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section. Excluding unusual items, our effective income tax rate increased to 23.4% for the first quarter of 2010. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 returned to normal rates as a result of our return to profitability in most jurisdictions. In addition, the effective rate for the first quarter of 2010 decreased by losses that were previously not benefited. Net Income (Loss) Net income increased $423 million to $223 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to a net loss of $200 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual item discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income increased $409 million. The increase in net income is the result of the increase in operating income partially offset by higher income taxes, both as discussed above. Earnings (Loss) per Share

The increase in diluted earnings per share is the result of an increase in net income partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the quarter. The increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to an increase in the number of diluted shares associated with restricted stock and stock options since such shares were anti-dilutive in the first quarter of 2009.

 Fixed assets, investments and other assets additions In the first quarter of 2010 we invested $133 million in fixed assets. While investments were made to refurbish or replace assets consumed in the normal course of business and for productivity improvements, a large portion of the investment in the first quarter of 2010 was for manufacturing equipment for programs that will be launching subsequent to the first quarter of 2010. In the first quarter of 2010, we invested $31 million in other assets related primarily to fully reimbursable planning and engineering costs at our complete vehicle engineering and assembly operations and our powertrain operations for programs that will be launching subsequent to the first quarter of 2010. Purchase of subsidiaries During the first quarter of 2010, we acquired two facilities in our complete vehicle engineering and assembly operations for cash consideration of $2 million. Proceeds from disposition Proceeds from disposal in the first quarter of 2010 were $165 million which included: 
 - normal course reimbursement received in respect of planning and
 engineering costs that were capitalized in prior periods;
 - the cash proceeds received on the sale of an electronics facility;
 - a cash payment received on the sale of a long-term engineering
 receivable; and

 In December 2008, in response to the uncertainty related to the financial viability of some of our key customers in North America, we drew down on our term and operating lines of credit. In February and March 2009, as the situation facing some of our key customers became clearer, we repaid $767 million of the outstanding lines of credit. During the first quarter of 2010, we received cash proceeds of $7 million on the exercise of stock options for Class A Subordinate Voting Shares. During the second quarter of 2009, our Board of Directors suspended payment of dividends and, as a result, no dividends were paid on our Class A Subordinate Voting or Class B Shares in the first quarter of 2010 compared to a dividend of $0.18 per share for the first quarter of 2009. 
Financing Resources As at As at March 31, December 31, 2010 2009 Change ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Liabilities Bank indebtedness $ 54 $ 48 Long-term debt due within one year 14 16 Long-term debt 102 115 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 170 179 Shareholders' equity 7,671 7,360 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total capitalization $ 7,841 $ 7,539 $ 302 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total capitalization increased by $0.3 billion to $7.8 billion at March 31, 2010 compared to $7.5 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase in capitalization was a result of a $0.3 billion increase in shareholders' equity. The increase in shareholders' equity was primarily as a result of: 
 - net income earned during the first quarter of 2010 (as discussed
 above);
 - net unrealized gains on cash flow hedges; and
 - a $17 million increase in accumulated net unrealized gains on
 translation of net investment in foreign operations, primarily as a
 result of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S.
 dollar between December 31, 2009 and March 31, 2010.
 
 Cash Resources During the first quarter of 2010, our cash resources increased by $0.1 billion to $1.4 billion primarily as a result of the cash provided from operating activities, as discussed above. In addition to our cash resources, we had term and operating lines of credit totalling $2.1 billion. The unused and available portion of our lines of credit decreased $0.1 billion to $1.8 billion during the first quarter of 2010. Maximum Number of Shares Issuable The following table presents the maximum number of shares that would be outstanding if all of the outstanding options and Subordinated Debentures issued and outstanding at May 6, 2010 were exercised or converted: 
 Class A Subordinate Voting and Class B Shares 112,764,722
 Stock options(i) 5,869,910
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 118,634,632
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- (i) Options to purchase Class A Subordinate Voting Shares are exercisable by the holder in accordance with the vesting provisions and upon payment of the exercise price as may be determined from time to time pursuant to our stock option plans. Includes options to acquire 2,525,000 Class A Subordinate Voting Shares which were granted conditional on ratification by our Shareholders at our Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 6, 2010. Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Financing There have been no material changes with respect to the contractual obligations requiring annual payments during the first quarter of 2010 that are outside the ordinary course of our business. Refer to our MD&A included in our 2009 Annual Report. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- On May 6, 2010, we entered into a transaction agreement with the Stronach Trust under which holders of our Class A Subordinate Voting Shares would be given the opportunity to decide whether to eliminate the dual class share capital structure. The proposed transaction would also: (i) set a termination date and declining fee schedule for the consulting, business development and business services contracts we have in place with Frank Stronach and his affiliated entities; and (ii) establish a joint venture with the Stronach group to jointly continue to pursue opportunities in the vehicle electrification business. (a) Terms of the Transaction If the arrangement is approved by Class A shareholders and the court, we would purchase for cancellation all 726,829 Class B Shares and, the Stronach Trust would indirectly receive 9.0 million newly issued Class A Shares and $300 million in cash. After the transaction, we would have 121.0 million shares outstanding, each of which would carry one vote. The shares held indirectly by the Stronach Trust would represent an equal equity ownership and voting interest of 7.4%. In addition, Magna's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation would be amended to remove the Class B Shares from the authorized capital and to make non-substantive consequential changes to our Articles, including renaming the Class A Subordinate Voting Shares as Common Shares and eliminating provisions which no longer apply due to the elimination of the Class B Shares. (b) Vehicle Electrification Joint Venture The proposed new joint venture would involve the engineering, development and integration of electric vehicles of any type, the development, testing and manufacturing of batteries and battery packs for hybrid (H) and electric vehicles (EV) and all ancillary activities in connection with electric vehicle technologies. We would invest $220 million for a 73% interest. Our contribution would include the assets of our recently established E-Car Systems vehicle electrification and battery business unit, certain other vehicle electrification assets, and the balance in cash. The Stronach group would invest $80 million in cash for a 27% interest in the joint venture and would have effective control through the right to appoint three of five board members. The proposed share capital reorganization would be implemented pursuant to a court-approved plan of arrangement and will require the approval of a majority of the votes cast by minority Class A shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders expected to take place in late June or July of this year. In addition to shareholder and court approvals, the transaction is subject to approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange, the finalization of definitive agreements and customary closing conditions, as well as certain amendments to the consulting agreements through which Frank Stronach, and certain of his affiliated entities provide consulting services to the Magna group of companies. The execution of the transaction agreement was approved by our Board of Directors after receiving the report of a Special Committee of independent directors of Magna. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- From time to time, we may be contingently liable for litigation and other claims. Refer to note 24 of our 2009 audited consolidated financial statements, which describes these claims. For a discussion of risk factors relating to legal and other claims against us, refer to page 35 of our Annual Information Form and Annual Report on Form 40-F, each in respect of the year ended December 31, 2009. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- The previous discussion contains statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of applicable securities legislation, including, but not limited to, statements relating to: European automobile sales and light vehicle production; and the timing of new program launches. The forward-looking information in this document is presented for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward-looking statements may include financial and other projections, as well as statements regarding our future plans, objectives or economic performance, or the assumptions underlying any of the foregoing, and other statements that are not recitations of historical fact. We use words such as ""may"", ""would"", ""could"", ""should"", ""will"", ""likely"", ""expect"", ""anticipate"", ""believe"", ""intend"", ""plan"", ""forecast"", ""outlook"", ""project"", ""estimate"" and similar expressions suggesting future outcomes or events to identify forward-looking statements. Any such forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and are based on assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and our perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors we believe are appropriate in the circumstances. However, whether actual results and developments will conform with our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks, assumptions and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and the effects of which can be difficult to predict, including, without limitation: the potential for a slower than anticipated economic recovery or a deterioration of economic conditions; production volumes and sales levels which are below forecast levels; our dependence on outsourcing by our customers; the termination or non renewal by our customers of any material contracts; our ability to identify and successfully exploit shifts in technology; restructuring, downsizing and/or other significant non-recurring costs; impairment charges; our ability to successfully grow our sales to non-traditional customers; unfavourable product or customer mix; risks of conducting business in foreign countries, including China, India, Brazil, Russia and other developing markets; our ability to quickly shift our manufacturing footprint to take advantage of lower cost manufacturing opportunities; disruptions in the capital and credit markets; fluctuations in relative currency values; our ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions; pricing pressures, including our ability to offset price concessions demanded by our customers; warranty and recall costs; the financial condition and credit worthiness of some of our OEM customers, including the potential that such customers may not make, or may seek to delay or reduce, payments owed to us; the financial condition of some of our suppliers and the risk of their insolvency, bankruptcy or financial restructuring; the highly competitive nature of the automotive parts supply business; product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage; changes in our mix of earnings between jurisdictions with lower tax rates and those with higher tax rates, as well as our ability to fully benefit tax losses; other potential tax exposures; legal claims against us; work stoppages and labour relations disputes; changes in laws and governmental regulations; costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations; potential conflicts of interest involving our indirect controlling shareholder, the Stronach Trust; and other factors set out in our Annual Information Form filed with securities commissions in Canada and our annual report on Form 40-F filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and subsequent filings. In evaluating forward-looking statements, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements and readers should specifically consider the various factors which could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. Unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, we do not intend, nor do we undertake any obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent information, events, results or circumstances or otherwise.

otherwise noted)
------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Magna International Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively ""Magna"" or the ""Company"") have been prepared in United States dollars following Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") with respect to the preparation of interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required in the preparation of annual financial statements and therefore should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2009 audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's 2009 Annual Report. These interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the same accounting policies as the December 31, 2009 annual consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which consist only of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position at March 31, 2010 and the results of operations and cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2010 and 2009. 2.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------- (b) Fair value The Company determined the estimated fair values of its financial instruments based on valuation methodologies it believes are appropriate; however, considerable judgment is required to develop these estimates. Accordingly, these estimated fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The estimated fair value amounts can be materially affected by the use of different assumptions or methodologies. The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments are described below: Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, bank indebtedness, accounts payable, accrued salaries and wages, other accrued liabilities and income taxes payable. Due to the short period to maturity of the instruments, the carrying values as presented in the consolidated balance sheets are reasonable estimates of fair values. Investments At March 31, 2010, the Company held Canadian third party asset- backed commercial paper (""ABCP"") with a face value of Cdn$127 million (December 31, 2009 - Cdn$134 million). The carrying value and estimated fair value of this investment was Cdn$84 million (December 31, 2009 - Cdn$88 million). As fair value information is not readily determinable for the Company's investment in ABCP, the fair value was based on a valuation technique estimating the fair value from the perspective of a market participant. During the quarter, the Company sold notes for approximately Cdn$4 million, which approximated their carrying value. Term debt The Company's term debt includes $14 million due within one year. Due to the short period to maturity of this debt, the carrying value as presented in the consolidated balance sheet is a reasonable estimate of its fair value. (c) Credit risk The Company's financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, held to maturity investments, and foreign exchange forward contracts with positive fair values. The Company's held for trading investments include an investment in ABCP. Given the continuing uncertainties regarding the value of the underlying assets, the amount and timing over cash flows and the risk of collateral calls in the event that spreads widened considerably, the Company could be exposed to further losses on its investment. Cash and cash equivalents, which consists of short-term investments, are only invested in governments, bank term deposits and bank commercial paper with an investment grade credit rating. Credit risk is further reduced by limiting the amount which is invested in certain governments or any major financial institution. The Company is also exposed to credit risk from the potential default by any of its counterparties on its foreign exchange forward contracts. The Company mitigates this credit risk by dealing with counterparties who are major financial institutions that the Company anticipates will satisfy their obligations under the contracts. In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to credit risk from its customers, substantially all of which are in the automotive industry and are subject to credit risks associated with the automotive industry. Sales to the Company's six largest customers represented 81% of the Company's total sales and substantially all of our sales are to customers in which the Company has ongoing contractual relationships. (d) Currency risk The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates when manufacturing facilities have committed to the delivery of products for which the selling price has been quoted in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency, or when materials and equipment are purchased in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency. In an effort to manage this net foreign exchange exposure, the Company employs hedging programs, primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. As at March 31, 2010, the net foreign exchange exposure was not material. (e) Interest rate risk The Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk due to the short-term maturity of its monetary current assets and current liabilities. In particular, the amount of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents is impacted more by the investment decisions made and the demands to have available cash on hand, than by movements in the interest rates over a given period. In addition, the Company is not exposed to interest rate risk on its long-term debt instruments as the interest rates on these instruments are fixed. 12. SEGMENTED INFORMATION Three months ended

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- (i) EBIT represents operating income from operations before income taxes and net interest income. 13. SUBSEQUENT EVENT On May 6, 2010, the Company entered into a transaction agreement with the Stronach Trust under which holders of Magna's Class A subordinate voting shares would be given the opportunity to decide whether to eliminate the dual class share capital structure. The proposed transaction would also: (i) set a termination date and declining fee schedule for the consulting, business development and business services contracts Magna has in place with Frank Stronach and his affiliated entities; and (ii) establish a joint venture with the Stronach group to jointly continue to pursue opportunities in the vehicle electrification business. (a) Terms of the Transaction If the arrangement is approved by Class A shareholders and the court, Magna would purchase for cancellation all 726,829 Class B Shares and, the Stronach Trust would indirectly receive 9.0 million newly issued Class A Shares and $300 million in cash. After the transaction, Magna would have 121.0 million shares outstanding, each of which would carry one vote. The shares held indirectly by the Stronach Trust would represent an equal equity ownership and voting interest of 7.4%. In addition, Magna's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation would be amended to remove the Class B Shares from the authorized capital and to make non-substantive consequential changes to its Articles, including renaming the Class A Subordinate Voting Shares as Common Shares and eliminating provisions which no longer apply due to the elimination of the Class B Shares. (b) Vehicle Electrification Joint Venture The proposed new joint venture would involve the engineering, development and integration of electric vehicles of any type, the development, testing and manufacturing of batteries and battery packs for hybrid (H) and electric vehicles (EV) and all ancillary activities in connection with electric vehicle technologies. Magna would invest $220 million for a 73% interest. Magna's contribution would include the assets of Magna's recently established E-Car Systems vehicle electrification and battery business unit, certain other vehicle electrification assets, and the balance in cash. The Stronach group would invest $80 million in cash for a 27% interest in the joint venture and would have effective control through the right to appoint three of five board members. The proposed share capital reorganization would be implemented pursuant to a court-approved plan of arrangement and will require the approval of a majority of the votes cast by minority Class A shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders expected to take place in late June or July of this year. In addition to shareholder and court approvals, the transaction is subject to approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange, the finalization of definitive agreements and customary closing conditions, as well as certain amendments to the consulting agreements through which Frank Stronach, and certain of his affiliated entities provide consulting services to the Magna group of companies. The execution of the transaction agreement was approved by Magna's Board of Directors after receiving the report of a Special Committee of independent directors of Magna. 14.

This lower sales level was a result of decreases in our North American and European production sales, complete vehicle assembly sales and tooling, engineering and other sales, offset in part by an increase in Rest of World production sales. </P> <P>External production sales in <SPAN class=xn-location>North America</SPAN> decreased 31% or <SPAN class=xn-money>$3.4 billion to $7.5 billion</SPAN> for the year ended <SPAN class=xn-chron>December 31, 2009</SPAN> compared to <SPAN class=xn-money>$10.9 billion</SPAN> for the year ended <SPAN class=xn-chron>December 31, 2008</SPAN>. This decrease in production sales reflects a 32% decrease in North American vehicle production volumes partially offset by a 1% increase in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. </P> <P>External production sales in <SPAN class=xn-location>Europe</SPAN> decreased 17% or <SPAN class=xn-money>$1.2 billion to $5.9 billion</SPAN> for the year ended <SPAN class=xn-chron>December 31, 2009</SPAN> compared to <SPAN class=xn-money>$7.1 billion</SPAN> for the year ended <SPAN class=xn-chron>December 31, 2008</SPAN>. This decrease in production sales reflects a 19% decrease in European vehicle production volumes partially offset by a 2% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. </P> <P>Complete vehicle assembly sales decreased 47% to <SPAN class=xn-money>$1.8 billion</SPAN> for 2009 compared to <SPAN class=xn-money>$3.3 billion</SPAN> for 2008, while complete vehicle assembly volumes declined 55% to approximately 57 thousand units. </P> <P>During 2009, operating loss was <SPAN class=xn-money>$511 million</SPAN>, net loss was <SPAN class=xn-money>$493 million</SPAN> and diluted loss per share was <SPAN class=xn-money>$4.41</SPAN>, decreases of <SPAN class=xn-money>$839 million</SPAN>, <SPAN class=xn-money>$564 million</SPAN> and <SPAN class=xn-money>$5.03</SPAN>, respectively, each compared to 2008. </P> <P>During 2009 and 2008, we recorded a number of unusual items, including impairment charges associated with goodwill, long-lived assets and future tax assets, restructuring charges, foreign currency gains, net losses on disposal of a facility, future tax charges and a curtailment gain. The aggregate charge to net income for 2009 and 2008 related to unusual items totalled <SPAN class=xn-money>$195</SPAN> and <SPAN class=xn-money>$313 million</SPAN>, respectively.

We design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced automotive systems, assemblies, modules and components, and engineer and assemble complete vehicles, primarily for sale to original equipment manufacturers (\""OEMs\"") of cars and light trucks. Our capabilities include the design, engineering, testing and manufacture of automotive interior systems; seating systems; closure systems; body and chassis systems; vision systems; electronic systems; exterior systems; powertrain systems; roof systems; hybrid and electric vehicles/systems; as well as complete vehicle engineering and assembly. We follow a corporate policy of functional and operational decentralization, pursuant to which we conduct our operations through divisions, each of which is an autonomous business unit operating within pre-determined guidelines. As at <SPAN class=xn-chron>December 31, 2009</SPAN>, we had 238 manufacturing divisions and 79 product development, engineering and sales centres in 25 countries. </P> <P>Our operations are segmented on a geographic basis between <SPAN class=xn-location>North America</SPAN>, <SPAN class=xn-location>Europe</SPAN> and Rest of World (primarily <SPAN class=xn-location>Asia</SPAN>, <SPAN class=xn-location>South America</SPAN> and <SPAN class=xn-location>Africa</SPAN>). A Co- Chief Executive Officer heads management in each of our two primary markets, <SPAN class=xn-location>North America</SPAN> and <SPAN class=xn-location>Europe</SPAN>. The role of the North American and European management teams is to manage our interests to ensure a coordinated effort across our different capabilities. In addition to maintaining key customer, supplier and government contacts in their respective markets, our regional management teams centrally manage key aspects of our operations while permitting our divisions enough flexibility through our decentralized structure to foster an entrepreneurial environment. </P> <P>HIGHLIGHTS</P> <P>------------------------------------------------------------------------- </P> <P>The automotive industry had a challenging year in 2009. The year began with weak global vehicle sales and production, most notably in the North American and Western European markets. In the first half of 2009, North American and Western European vehicle production declined 50% and 33%, respectively, as compared to the first half of 2008. The worsening economic and industry conditions which became apparent in the second half of 2008 accelerated the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of OEMs and suppliers, culminating in the bankruptcy filings of Chrysler and General Motors in April and June, respectively. During their respective periods under bankruptcy protection, vehicle production for Chrysler and General Motors was negligible. More generally, annualized vehicle sales in <SPAN class=xn-location>North America</SPAN> for the first half of 2009 remained at levels not experienced for more than 25 years. European vehicle sales and production, while down significantly from the previous year, were buoyed by a number of \""scrappage\"" programs implemented by various European governments, which generally provided financial incentives for consumers to replace older, less fuel-efficient and typically higher polluting vehicles, with new vehicles, thereby stimulating vehicle sales. </P> <P>We began to see signs of improvement in the second half of 2009, particularly in <SPAN class=xn-location>North America</SPAN>. New vehicle selling rates strengthened, as consumer confidence levels increased and economic stimuli began to work their way through various economies. In <SPAN class=xn-location>North America</SPAN>, vehicle inventory days declined to levels which were below long term trend levels, due in part to production shut-downs and the positive effect of a vehicle scrappage program implemented in <SPAN class=xn-location>the United States</SPAN>. </P> <P>Nevertheless, by historical standards, full year vehicle sales and production in <SPAN class=xn-location>North America</SPAN> and <SPAN class=xn-location>Western Europe</SPAN> remained at low levels. North American vehicle production ended 2009 down 32%, as compared to 2008, marking the seventh straight year of declining production. Western European production declined 19% compared to 2008, despite the impact of the various scrappage programs. </P> <P>In 2009, we continued with restructuring and downsizing actions in order to mitigate the impact of continued production volume declines. We also undertook a number of other cost-saving measures, including reduced discretionary spending across the organization, employee reductions, short work week schedules, reduced bonuses, voluntary wage reductions and benefit plan changes. </P> <P>Despite these actions, the weak production environment adversely impacted our 2009 operating results. Total sales declined 27% in 2009, compared to 2008, primarily as a result of the declines in vehicle production in <SPAN class=xn-location>North America</SPAN> and <SPAN class=xn-location>Western Europe</SPAN>, along with a 47% decline in complete vehicle assembly sales and a 16% decline in tooling, engineering and other sales. Operating income for 2009 decreased <SPAN class=xn-money>$839 million</SPAN>, to a loss of <SPAN class=xn-money>$511 million</SPAN>, from income of <SPAN class=xn-money>$328 million</SPAN> in 2008. </P> <P>On the positive side, the severe industry conditions provided opportunities for us to strengthen our business relative to some of our competitors. We were successful in securing significant takeover business in 2009. We also completed selective acquisitions, including Cadence Innovation s.r.o, located primarily in the <SPAN class=xn-location>Czech Republic</SPAN> (\""Cadence\""), and several facilities in <SPAN class=xn-location>Mexico</SPAN> and the U.S. from Meridian Automotive Systems Inc. (\""Meridian\""). </P> <P>An additional bright spot was the continued growth of our business and manufacturing footprint outside our traditional markets of <SPAN class=xn-location>North America</SPAN> and <SPAN class=xn-location>Western Europe</SPAN>, which contributed to a 31% increase in Rest of World production sales, our eighth straight year of increasing production sales in this segment. </P> <P>During a period when several of our automotive supplier competitors ceased operations, were consolidated or experienced significant financial difficulties, our strong balance sheet and overall financial flexibility leading into the economic downturn, coupled with our financial discipline, cash flow generation and significant cash preservation and cost cutting efforts allowed us to preserve shareholder value and position us well to enhance such value in the future. </P> <P>Our strong financial position allows us to continue to invest in innovation. Notably, in the past few years, we have been investing to expand our capabilities and footprint in electronics. We see electronics as an area of future growth for the automotive industry and for Magna. More recently, we have been investing to develop our component, system and integration capabilities in the growing hybrid/electric vehicle market. However, we will need to further invest in both electronics and hybrid/electric vehicle systems before we generate appropriate returns from these investments. Our investments in these areas negatively impacted our earnings in 2009, and our planned investments in 2010 are expected to be higher. </P> <P>After a very turbulent year in many automotive markets, we expect global vehicle production to grow this year, led by growth in <SPAN class=xn-location>North America</SPAN>, provided that overall economic conditions continue to improve. Forecast growth in North American vehicle production would reverse the seven year slide experienced in this critical vehicle market. We are less optimistic about the near-term growth potential of the Western European market, which we believe will lag in 2010 due to the impact in 2009 of scrappage incentives which mitigated what would likely have been much weaker vehicle demand last year by \""pulling forward\"" sales. </P> <P>FINANCIAL RESULTS SUMMARY</P> <P>------------------------------------------------------------------------- </P> <P>During 2009, we posted sales of <SPAN class=xn-money>$17.4 billion</SPAN>, a decrease of 27% from 2008. This lower sales level was a result of decreases in our North American and European production sales, complete vehicle assembly sales and tooling, engineering and other sales offset in part by an increase in our Rest of World production sales. Comparing 2009 to 2008: </P><PRE>    -   North American average dollar content per vehicle increased 1%, while\n        vehicle production declined 32%;\n    -   European average dollar content per vehicle increased 2%, while\n        vehicle production declined 19%; and\n    -   Complete vehicle assembly sales decreased 47% to $1.8 billion from\n        $3.3 billion, as complete vehicle assembly volumes declined 55%.\n\n\n</PRE> <P>During 2009, we generated an operating loss of <SPAN class=xn-money>$511 million</SPAN> compared to operating income of <SPAN class=xn-money>$328 million</SPAN> for 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2009 and 2008, as discussed in the \""Unusual Items\"" section, operating income declined <SPAN class=xn-money>$899 million</SPAN>. Included in operating income for 2009 and 2008 are several \""Significant Items\"" that impact operating income representing approximately <SPAN class=xn-money>$220 million</SPAN> and <SPAN class=xn-money>$85 million</SPAN>, respectively. \""Significant Items\"" consist primarily of: </P><PRE>    -   downsizing and other restructuring activities that have not been\n        included in the \""Unusual Items\"" section;\n    -   accounts receivable valuation allowances recorded in 2009;\n    -   in 2009, a $9 million favourable adjustment (2008 - $41 million\n        impairment) of our investment in ABCP as discussed in the \""Cash\n        Resources\"" section;\n    -   a favourable settlement on research and development incentives during\n        2008;\n    -   due diligence costs associated with our planned investment in Opel,\n        which terminated during 2009;\n    -   accelerated amortization of deferred wage buydown assets at a\n        powertrain systems facility in the United States during 2008;\n    -   the write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related\n        to the cancelation of an assembly program in the fourth quarter of\n        2009;\n    -   costs related to the delay in the start of production of a program;\n        and\n    -   other losses on disposal of assets.\n\n\n</PRE> <P>In addition, operating income was negatively impacted by: </P><PRE>    -   decreased margin earned on reduced sales as a result of significantly\n        lower vehicle production volumes;\n    -   costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches or for programs\n        that have not fully ramped up production primarily in Europe;\n    -   operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities;\n    -   costs incurred at new facilities in Russia as we continue to pursue\n        opportunities in this market;\n    -   electric vehicle development costs;\n    -   costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics capabilities;\n    -   higher commodity costs; and\n    -   net customer price concessions.\n\n\n</PRE> <P>These factors were partially offset by: </P><PRE>    -   the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost\n        savings initiatives (including reduced discretionary spending,\n        employee reductions, short work week schedules, reduced bonuses,\n        voluntary wage reductions and benefit plan changes), undertaken\n        during or subsequent to 2008;\n    -   productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities; and\n    -   incremental margin earned from acquisitions completed during or\n        subsequent to 2008.\n\n\n</PRE> <P>During 2009, net loss was <SPAN class=xn-money>$493 million</SPAN> compared to net income of <SPAN class=xn-money>$71 million</SPAN> for 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2009 and 2008, as discussed in the \""Unusual Items\"" section, net income for 2009 decreased <SPAN class=xn-money>$682 million</SPAN>. The decrease in net income was a result of the decrease in operating income partially offset by lower income taxes. </P> <P>During 2009, our diluted loss per share was <SPAN class=xn-money>$4.41</SPAN> compared to diluted earnings per share of <SPAN class=xn-money>$0.62</SPAN> for 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2009 and 2008, as discussed in the \""Unusual Items\"" section, diluted earnings per share for 2009 decreased <SPAN class=xn-money>$6.04</SPAN>. The decrease in diluted earnings per share is as a result of the decrease in net income, excluding unusual items, and a decrease in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during 2009. The decrease in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to the effect of the repurchase and cancelation of Class A Subordinate Voting Shares in 2008 under the terms of our Normal Course Issuer Bid and a decrease in the number of diluted shares associated with restricted stock and stock options since such shares were anti-dilutive in 2009. </P> <P>UNUSUAL ITEMS </P> <P>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</P> <P>During the three months and years ended <SPAN class=xn-chron>December 31, 2009</SPAN> and 2008, we recorded certain unusual items as follows: </P><PRE>                                  2009                       2008\n                      ---------------------------- --------------------------\n                                          Diluted                    Diluted\n                                         Earnings   Operat-         Earnings\n                      Operating      Net      per       ing     Net      per\n                         Income   Income    Share    Income  Income    Share\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Fourth Quarter\n      Impairment\n       charges(1)       $  (108) $  (106) $ (0.95) $   (16) $   (16) $ (0.15)\n      Restructuring\n       charges(1)           (20)     (20)   (0.18)     (80)     (56)   (0.50)\n      Sale of\n       facility(2)           (8)      (8)   (0.07)       -

Based on the reporting unit's discounted forecast cashflows, we recorded a $25 million goodwill impairment charge.</P> <P>In addition, during the second quarter of 2009, after failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York, we decided to wind down these operations. Given the significance of the facility's cashflows in relation to the reporting unit, management determined that it was more likely than not that goodwill at the Powertrain North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired. Therefore, we recorded a $75 million goodwill impairment charge.</P> <P>The goodwill impairment charges were calculated by determining the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if we had acquired the Powertrain and CTS reporting units as at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009, respectively.</P> <P>(ii) Long-lived Assets</P> <P>Also in conjunction with our annual business planning cycle, during the fourth quarter of 2009 we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $83 million.</P> <P>In North America, we recorded charges of $13 million related to fixed assets at a die casting facility in Canada and an anticipated under recovery of capitalized tooling costs at a stamping facility in the United States due to significantly lower volumes on certain SUV programs.</P> <P>In Europe, we recorded long-lived assets impairment charges of $70 million related to our CTS and exterior systems operations in Germany.</P> <P>At our CTS operations, long-lived asset impairment charges of $59 million were recorded related to fixed and intangible assets. The impairment charge was calculated based on CTS' discounted forecast cashflows and was necessary primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic reduction in the market for soft tops, hard tops and modular retractable hard tops; and (ii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout our business planning period.</P> <P>At our interiors and exteriors operations, we recorded an $11 million asset impairment charge related to specific under-utilized assets in Germany.</P> <P>(iii) Restructuring Costs</P> <P>During 2009, we recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $23 million in cost of goods sold and $3 million in selling, general and administrative expense. During the second quarter, we recorded restructuring costs of $6 million related to the planned closure of a powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York and during the fourth quarter we recorded severance and other termination benefits related to the closure of powertrain and interior systems facilities in Germany. Substantially all of the $26 million will be paid subsequent to 2009.</P> <P>In addition, during 2009 and 2008, we incurred costs related to downsizing various operations in our traditional markets.</P> <P>(b) For the year ended December 31, 2008</P> <P>(i) Long-lived Assets</P> <P>As a result of the significant and accelerated declines in vehicle production volumes, primarily in North America, we reviewed goodwill and long- lived assets for impairment during the third quarter of 2008. Based on this analysis, during 2008 we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $283 million related primarily to our powertrain, and interior and exterior systems operations in the United States and Canada.</P> <P>At our powertrain operations, particularly at a facility in Syracuse, New York, asset impairment charges of $189 million were recorded primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic market shift away from truck programs, in particular four wheel drive pick-up trucks and SUVs; (ii) excess die-casting, machining and assembly capacity; and (iii) historical losses that were projected to continue throughout our business planning period.</P> <P>At our interiors and exteriors operations, we recorded $74 million of asset impairment charges primarily as a result of: (i) significantly lower volumes on certain pick-up truck and SUV programs; (ii) the loss of certain replacement business; (iii) capacity utilization that is not sufficient to support the current overhead structure; and (iv) historical losses that were projected to continue throughout our business planning period.</P> <P>Additionally, in North America we recorded asset impairment charges of $12 million related to dedicated assets at a chassis systems facility in Canada and a seating systems facility in the United States. In Europe, we recorded an $8 million asset impairment related to specific assets at an interior systems facility in the United Kingdom and specific assets at a powertrain systems facility in Austria.</P> <P>(ii) Restructuring Charges</P> <P>During 2008, we recorded restructuring and rationalization costs in North America of $79 million in cost of goods sold and $5 million in selling, general and administrative expense. These restructuring and rationalization costs were primarily recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008 and relate to: (i) the consolidation of interiors and exteriors operations in Canada and the United States; (ii) the closure of a seating systems facility in St. Louis, Missouri; (iii) the consolidation of closure systems operations in Canada; and (iv) the consolidation of our powertrain die casting operations in Canada and the United States. During 2008, we also incurred costs related to downsizing various operations.</P> <P>(2) Sale of Facility</P> <P>During 2009, we entered into an agreement to sell an engineering centre in Europe and, as a result, incurred a loss on disposition of the facility of $8 million.</P> <P>(3) Foreign Currency Gains</P> <P>In the normal course of business, we review our cash investment and tax planning strategies, including where such funds are invested. As a result of these reviews, during the third quarter of 2008 we repatriated funds from Europe and as a result recorded foreign currency gains of $116 million.</P> <P>(4) Income Taxes</P> <P>During the third quarter of 2008, we recorded a $123 million charge to establish valuation allowances against all of our future tax assets in the United States.</P> <P>The valuation allowances were required in the United States based on historical consolidated losses at our U.S. operations, that were expected to continue in the near-term, the accelerated deterioration of near-term automotive market conditions in the United States and the significant and inherent uncertainty as to the timing of when we would be able to generate the necessary level of earnings to recover these future tax assets.</P> <P>(5) Curtailment gain</P> <P>During the second quarter of 2009, we amended our Retiree Premium Reimbursement Plan in Canada and the United States, such that most employees retiring on or after August 1, 2009 will no longer participate in the plan. The amendment will reduce service costs and retirement medical benefit expense in 2009 and future years. As a result of amending the plan, a curtailment gain of $26 million was recorded in cost of goods sold in the second quarter of 2009.</P> <P>INDUSTRY TRENDS AND RISKS</P> <P>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</P> <P>With the apparent stabilization and improvement in the global automotive industry in the second half of 2009, a number of the trends which impacted the industry and our business beginning in the second half of 2008 appear to be diminishing. For example, vehicle production levels, particularly in <SPAN class=xn-location>North America</SPAN>, appear to be improving as compared to the low levels experienced in the second half of 2008 and first half of 2009. However, forecast vehicle production levels in both <SPAN class=xn-location>North America</SPAN> and <SPAN class=xn-location>Europe</SPAN> for 2010 remain significantly below historic averages and remain sensitive to continued improvement in overall economic conditions. Similarly, while the short-term viability of several of our customers has improved due to significant government intervention and restructuring actions, the long-term viability of certain of our customers remains uncertain. Continued improvement in the global automotive industry is heavily dependent on factors such as consumer confidence, employment levels, household debt, real estate values, the continued availability of consumer credit, interest rates, energy prices and other factors. At this time, it is too early to determine whether the apparent stabilization and improvement in the economy and automotive industry in the second half of 2009 will continue. </P> <P>The impact of other recent trends also remains uncertain. For example, as a result of the restructuring of the global automotive industry in 2008/2009, the financial condition of the automotive supply base deteriorated significantly, with a number of suppliers restructuring while under bankruptcy protection or ceasing operations altogether. In the short-term, we have secured a significant amount of takeover business as our customers transferred business from weak suppliers to stronger suppliers. However, the mid to long- term impact of the restructuring of the automotive supply base cannot be determined at this time. Some of our competitors have successfully emerged from bankruptcy restructurings, leaving them with strong balance sheets, reduced cost structures and improved overall competitiveness. </P> <P>One recent and growing trend in the automotive industry, born out of the need to carefully manage costs, is the growth of cooperative alliances and arrangements among competing automotive OEMs. New and increasing relationships include features such as: shared purchasing of components; joint engine, powertrain and/or platform development; and engine, powertrain and platform sharing. Cooperation among competing OEMs is expected to increase, particularly with respect to vehicle hybridization and electrification, in order to lower the entry cost for OEMs to compete in these vehicle segments. </P> <P>A number of general trends which have been impacting the automotive industry in recent years are expected to continue, including: </P><PRE>    -   the exertion of pricing pressure by OEMs;\n\n    -   government incentives and consumer demand for, and industry focus on,\n        more fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly vehicles with\n        alternative-energy fuel systems and additional safety features;\n\n    -   governmental regulation of fuel economy and emissions;\n\n    -   the long-term growth of the automotive industry in China, India,\n        Brazil, Russia and other developing markets, including accelerated\n        migration of component and vehicle design, development, engineering\n        and manufacturing to certain of these markets;\n\n    -   the growth of the A to D vehicle segments (micro to mid-size cars),\n        particularly in developing markets; and\n\n    -   the consolidation of vehicle platforms.\n\n\n</PRE> <P>The following are some of the more significant risks that could affect our ability to achieve our desired results: </P><PRE>    -   The global automotive industry is cyclical and is sensitive to\n        changes in economic and political conditions, including interest\n        rates, energy prices and international conflicts. Commencing in the\n        second half of 2008, the automotive industry experienced a more\n        severe cyclical downturn than in prior cycles due to the disruption\n        of global credit markets beginning in September 2008, the\n        corresponding reduction in access to credit (particularly for\n        purposes of vehicle financing), the deterioration of housing and\n        equity markets and the resulting erosion in personal net worth, all\n        of which led to extremely low consumer confidence, particularly in\n        the U.S and which in turn, severely impacted automotive sales. While\n        the global economy is currently showing signs of improvement,\n        uncertainty remains. As a result of restructuring actions taken by\n        OEMs and suppliers during the most recent cyclical downturn,\n        automotive production levels are more closely aligned with actual\n        automotive sales levels and, accordingly, are sensitive to overall\n        economic conditions. The continuation of current or lower production\n        volumes and sales levels for an extended period of time could have a\n        material adverse effect on our profitability.\n\n    -   While the global economy is currently experiencing a gradual recovery\n        and the condition of the global automotive industry appears to have\n        stabilized and improved beginning in the latter half of 2009,\n        considerable uncertainty remains as to the breadth and depth of a\n        global economic and industry recovery, including the timing of a\n        return to more normal market conditions. As a result of this\n        continued uncertainty, we remain subject to considerable planning\n        risk with respect to our business. A slower than anticipated recovery\n        or a deterioration of economic conditions could have a material\n        adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.\n\n    -   The short-term viability of several of our OEM customers appears to\n        have improved as a result of restructuring actions in the past few\n        years, as well as extraordinary levels of government financial\n        intervention in the automotive industry, particularly in 2009.\n        However, there can be no assurance that these restructuring actions\n        will be successful in ensuring their long- term viability, nor can\n        there be any assurance that government financial assistance will be\n        made available at levels necessary to prevent OEM failures in the\n        future. The bankruptcy of any of our major customers could have a\n        material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.\n        Additionally, since OEMs rely on a highly interdependent network of\n        suppliers, an OEM bankruptcy could materially disrupt the supply\n        chain, which could have a material adverse effect on our\n        profitability and financial condition.\n\n    -   We rely on a number of suppliers to supply us with a wide range of\n        components required in connection with our business. While the\n        automotive supply base appears to be stabilizing following the severe\n        cyclical downturn which commenced in the second half of 2008, the\n        financial health of automotive suppliers is impacted by economic\n        conditions, production volume cuts, intense pricing pressures and\n        other factors. The insolvency or bankruptcy of a supplier could\n        disrupt the supply of components to us or our customers, potentially\n        causing the temporary shut-down of our or our customers' production\n        lines. Any prolonged disruption in the supply of critical components\n        to us or our customers, the inability to re source or insource\n        production of a critical component from a financially distressed\n        automotive components sub-supplier, or any temporary shut-down of one\n        of our production lines or the production lines of one of our\n        customers, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\n        Additionally, the insolvency, bankruptcy or financial restructuring\n        of any of our critical suppliers could result in us incurring\n        unrecoverable costs related to the financial work-out of such\n        suppliers and/or increased exposure for product liability, warranty\n        or recall costs relating to the components supplied by such suppliers\n        to the extent such supplier is not able to assume responsibility for\n        such amounts, which could have an adverse effect on our\n        profitability.\n\n    -   The automotive parts supply industry is highly competitive. As a\n        result of our diversified automotive business, we face a number of\n        competitors possessing varying degrees of financial and operational\n        strength in each our of product and service capabilities. Some of our\n        competitors have a substantially greater market share than us and are\n        dominant in some of the markets in which we do business. In addition,\n        recent restructuring actions taken by some of our competitors have\n        provided them with improved financial and operational flexibility and\n        could increase their competitive threat to our business, including\n        increasing their market share at our expense. We may not be able to\n        compete successfully with our existing competitors or with any new\n        competitors, which could have an adverse effect on our operations and\n        profitability.\n\n    -   We are dependent on the outsourcing of components, modules and\n        assemblies, as well as complete vehicles, by OEMs. The extent of OEM\n        outsourcing is influenced by a number of factors, including relative\n        cost, quality and timeliness of production by suppliers as compared\n        to OEMs, capacity utilization, labour relations among OEMs, their\n        employees and unions and other considerations. As a result of lower\n        cost structures due to recent restructuring actions, some OEMs may\n        insource production which had previously been outsourced. Outsourcing\n        of complete vehicle assembly is particularly dependent on the degree\n        of unutilized capacity at the OEMs' own assembly facilities, in\n        addition to the foregoing factors. A reduction in outsourcing by\n        OEMs, or the loss of any material production or assembly programs\n        coupled with the failure to secure alternative programs with\n        sufficient volumes and margins, could have a material adverse effect\n        on our profitability.\n\n    -   We continue to invest in technology and innovation, including certain\n        alternative-energy technologies which we believe will be critical to\n        our long-term growth. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology\n        and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products\n        on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to\n        remain competitive. If there is a shift away from the use of\n        technologies in which we are investing, our costs may not be fully\n        recovered. In addition, if other technologies in which our investment\n        is not as great or our expertise is not as developed emerge as the\n        industry-leading technologies, we may be placed at a competitive\n        disadvantage, which could have a material adverse effect on our\n        profitability and financial condition.\n\n    -   As part of our strategy of continuously seeking to optimize our\n        global manufacturing footprint, we may further rationalize some of\n        our production facilities. In the course of such rationalization, we\n        may incur further restructuring and/or downsizing costs related to\n        plant closings, relocations and employee severance costs. Such costs\n        could have an adverse effect on our short-term profitability. In\n        addition, we are working to turn around financially underperforming\n        divisions; however, there is no guarantee that we will be successful\n        in doing so with respect to some or all such divisions.\n\n\n    -   We recorded significant impairment charges related to goodwill, long-\n        lived assets and future tax assets in recent years and may continue\n        to do so in the future. The bankruptcy of a significant customer or\n        the early termination, loss, renegotiation of the terms of, or delay\n        in the implementation of any significant production contract could be\n        indicators of impairment. In addition, to the extent that forward-\n        looking assumptions regarding the impact of improvement plans on\n        current operations, insourcing and other new business opportunities,\n        program price and cost assumptions on current and future business,\n        the timing of new program launches and forecast production volumes\n        are not met, any resulting impairment loss could have a material\n        adverse effect on our profitability.\n\n    -   Although we supply parts to all of the leading OEMs, a significant\n        majority of our sales are to six such customers. While we have\n        diversified our customer base somewhat in recent years and continue\n        to attempt to further diversify, particularly to increase our\n        business with Asian-based OEMs, there is no assurance we will be\n        successful. Our inability to successfully grow our sales to non-\n        traditional customers could have a material adverse effect on our\n        profitability.\n\n    -   While we supply parts for a wide variety of vehicles produced in\n        North America and Europe, we do not supply parts for all vehicles\n        produced, nor is the number or value of parts evenly distributed\n        among the vehicles for which we do supply parts. Shifts in market\n        share among vehicles (including shifts away from vehicles we assemble\n        or shifts away from specific parts we produce) or the early\n        termination, loss, renegotiation of the terms of, or delay in the\n        implementation of any significant production or assembly contract\n        could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\n\n    -   Many of our customers have sought, and will likely continue to seek\n        to take advantage of lower operating costs in China, India, Brazil,\n        Russia and other developing markets. While we continue to expand our\n        manufacturing footprint with a view to taking advantage of\n        manufacturing opportunities in these markets, we cannot guarantee\n        that we will be able to fully realize such opportunities.\n        Additionally, the establishment of manufacturing operations in\n        developing market countries carries its own risks, including those\n        relating to political and economic instability; trade, customs and\n        tax risks; currency exchange rates; currency controls; insufficient\n        infrastructure; and other risks associated with conducting business\n        internationally. The inability to quickly adjust our manufacturing\n        footprint to take advantage of manufacturing opportunities in these\n        markets could harm our ability to compete with other suppliers\n        operating in or from such markets, which could have an adverse effect\n        on our profitability.\n\n    -   Recently, several major financial institutions failed or required\n        massive government intervention in order to prevent collapse. The\n        turmoil in the financial sector significantly affected the global\n        economy, and contributed to a global recession. While financial\n        markets appear to have stabilized, the failure of any major financial\n        institutions in the future could lead to significant disruptions in\n        capital and credit markets and could adversely affect our and our\n        customers' ability to access needed liquidity for working capital. In\n        addition, in the event of a failure of a financial institution; in\n        which we invest our cash reserves; that is a counterparty in a\n        derivative transaction with us; or a lender to us, we face the risk\n        that that our cash reserves and amounts owing to us pursuant to\n        derivative transactions may not be fully recoverable, or the amount\n        of credit available to us may be significantly reduced. All of these\n        risks could have an impact on our financial condition.\n\n    -   Although our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a\n        significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in\n        Canadian dollars, euros, British pounds and other currencies. Our\n        profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against the\n        Canadian dollar, the euro, the British pound and other currencies in\n        which we generate revenues and incur expenses. However, as a result\n        of hedging programs employed by us, foreign currency transactions are\n        not fully impacted by movements in exchange rates. We record foreign\n        currency transactions at the hedged rate where applicable. Despite\n        these measures, significant long-term fluctuations in relative\n        currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative\n        values of the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, euro or British pound,\n        could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial\n        condition and any sustained change in such related currency values\n        could adversely impact our competitiveness in certain geographic\n        regions.\n\n    -   We have completed a number of significant acquisitions in recent\n        years and may continue to do so in the future. In those product areas\n        in which we have identified acquisitions as critical to our business\n        strategy, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition targets\n        or successfully acquire any suitable targets which we identify.\n        Additionally, we may not be able to successfully integrate or achieve\n        anticipated synergies from those acquisitions which we do complete\n        and such failure could have a material adverse effect on our\n        profitability.\n\n    -   We face significant pricing pressure, as well as pressure to absorb\n        costs related to product design, engineering and tooling, as well as\n        other items previously paid for directly by OEMs. These pressures are\n        expected to continue, even as the industry begins to recover from the\n        global recession. The continuation or intensification of these\n        pricing pressures and pressure to absorb costs could have an adverse\n        effect on our profitability.\n\n    -   Our customers continue to demand that we bear the cost of the repair\n        and replacement of defective products which are either covered under\n        their warranty or are the subject of a recall by them. Warranty\n        provisions are established based on our best estimate of the amounts\n        necessary to settle existing or probable claims on product defect\n        issues. Recall costs are costs incurred when government regulators\n        and/or our customers decide to recall a product due to a known or\n        suspected performance issue and we are required to participate either\n        voluntarily or involuntarily. Currently, under most customer\n        agreements, we only account for existing or probable warranty claims.\n        Under certain complete vehicle engineering and assembly contracts, we\n        record an estimate of future warranty-related costs based on the\n        terms of the specific customer agreements and the specific customer's\n        warranty experience. The obligation to repair or replace such\n        products could have a material adverse effect on our profitability\n        and financial condition if the actual costs are materially different\n        from our estimates.\n\n    -   From time to time, we may become liable for legal, contractual and\n        other claims by various parties, including customers, suppliers,\n        former employees, class action plaintiffs and others. On an on going\n        basis, we attempt to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments\n        or outcomes to these claims, although it is difficult to predict\n        final outcomes with any degree of certainty. At this time, we do not\n        believe that any of the claims to which we are party will have a\n        material adverse effect on our financial position; however, we cannot\n        provide any assurance to this effect. </PRE> <P>RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</P> <P>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</P><PRE>    Average Foreign Exchange\n\n                             For the three months            For the year\n                               ended December 31,          ended December 31,\n                           ----------------------     -----------------------\n                           2009     2008   Change     2009     2008   Change\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    1 Canadian dollar\n     equals U.S. dollars  0.948    0.828   +  14%    0.882    0.944   -   7%\n    1 euro equals U.S.\n     dollars              1.477    1.320   +  12%    1.395    1.470   -   5%\n    1 British pound\n     equals U.S. dollars  1.635    1.569   +   4%    1.565    1.852   -  16%\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n</PRE> <P>The preceding table reflects the average foreign exchange rates between the most common currencies in which we conduct business and our U.S. dollar reporting currency.

Under certain contracts we are acting as principal and purchased components and systems in assembled vehicles are included in our inventory and cost of sales. These costs are reflected on a full cost basis in the selling price of the final assembled vehicle to the OEM customer. Other contracts provide that third-party components and systems are held on consignment by us, and the selling price to the OEM customer reflects a value added assembly fee only. </P> <P>Production levels of the various vehicles assembled by us have an impact on the level of our sales and profitability. In addition, the relative proportion of programs accounted for on a full cost basis and programs accounted for on a value added basis also impacts our level of sales and operating margin percentage, but may not necessarily affect our overall level of profitability. Assuming no change in total vehicles assembled, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a full cost basis has the effect of increasing the level of total sales, however, because purchased components are included in cost of sales, profitability as a percentage of total sales is reduced. Conversely, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a value added basis has the effect of reducing the level of total sales and increasing profitability as a percentage of total sales. </P><PRE>                                                  For the year\n                                                ended December 31,\n                                              --------------------\n                                                  2009       2008     Change\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Complete Vehicle Assembly Sales           $  1,764   $  3,306     -  47%\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Complete Vehicle Assembly Volumes (Units)\n      Full-Costed:\n        BMW X3, Mercedes-Benz G-Class, Peugeot\n         RCZ and Saab 93 Convertible            51,244     97,229     -  47%\n      Value-Added:\n        Jeep Grand Cherokee, Chrysler 300,\n         and Jeep Commander                      5,376     28,207     -  81%\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                56,620    125,436     -  55%\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n</PRE> <P>Complete vehicle assembly sales decreased 47% or <SPAN class=xn-money>$1.5 billion to $1.8 billion</SPAN> for the year ended <SPAN class=xn-chron>December 31, 2009</SPAN> compared to <SPAN class=xn-money>$3.3 billion</SPAN> for the year ended <SPAN class=xn-chron>December 31, 2008</SPAN> while assembly volumes decreased 55% or 68,816 units.

Excluding the unusual items discussed in the \""Unusual Items\"" section, operating income for 2009 decreased <SPAN class=xn-money>$899 million</SPAN>.

These decreases were partially offset by debt assumed on the acquisition of Cadence. </P> <P>The decrease in shareholders' equity was primarily as a result of: </P><PRE>    -   the net loss incurred during 2009; and\n    -   dividends paid during the first quarter of 2009.\n\n\n</PRE> <P>These factors were partially offset by: </P><PRE>    -   a $407 million increase in accumulated net unrealized gains on\n        translation of our net investment in foreign operations, primarily\n        as a result of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, euro and\n        British pound, each against the U.S. dollar between December 31,\n        2008 and December 31, 2009; and\n    -   net unrealized gains on cash flow hedges and the reclassification of\n        net losses on cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive\n        income to net loss.\n\n\n</PRE> <P>Cash Resources </P> <P>During 2009, our cash resources decreased by <SPAN class=xn-money>$1.4 billion to $1.3 billion</SPAN> primarily as a result of the net repayment of <SPAN class=xn-money>$0.9 billion</SPAN> on our outstanding lines of credit, cash used in investing activities, the repayment of our 7.08% Subordinated Debentures and the repayment of our 6.5% Convertible Subordinate Debentures, all as discussed previously.

Operating lease payments in 2009 for facilities leased from MID and third parties were <SPAN class=xn-money>$149 million</SPAN> and <SPAN class=xn-money>$131 million</SPAN>, respectively. Operating lease commitments in 2010 for facilities leased from MID and third parties are expected to be <SPAN class=xn-money>$150 million</SPAN> and <SPAN class=xn-money>$128 million</SPAN>, respectively. Our existing leases with MID generally provide for periodic rent escalations based either on fixed-rate step increases, or on the basis of a consumer price index adjustment (subject to certain caps). </P> <P>We also have operating lease commitments for equipment. These leases are generally of shorter duration. Operating lease payments for equipment were <SPAN class=xn-money>$42 million</SPAN> for 2009, and are expected to be <SPAN class=xn-money>$41 million</SPAN> in 2010. </P> <P>Although our consolidated contractual annual lease commitments decline year by year, we expect that existing leases will either be renewed or replaced, or alternatively, we will incur capital expenditures to acquire equivalent capacity. </P> <P>Foreign Currency Activities </P> <P>Our North American operations negotiate sales contracts with OEMs for payment in both U.S. and Canadian dollars. Materials and equipment are purchased in various currencies depending upon competitive factors, including relative currency values. The North American operations use labour and materials which are paid for in both U.S. and Canadian dollars. Our Mexican operations generally use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. </P> <P>Our European operations negotiate sales contracts with OEMs for payment principally in euros and British pounds. The European operations' material, equipment and labour are paid for principally in euros and British pounds. </P> <P>We employ hedging programs, primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts, in an effort to manage our foreign exchange exposure, which arises when manufacturing facilities have committed to the delivery of products for which the selling price has been quoted in foreign currencies. These commitments represent our contractual obligations to deliver products over the duration of the product programs, which can last a number of years. The amount and timing of the forward contracts will be dependent upon a number of factors, including anticipated production delivery schedules and anticipated production costs, which may be paid in the foreign currency. In addition, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign exchange exposure with respect to internal funding arrangements. Despite these measures, significant long term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative values of the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, euro or British pound, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition (as discussed throughout this MD&amp;A). </P> <P>RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009</P> <P>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</P> <P>FINANCIAL RESULTS SUMMARY</P> <P>------------------------------------------------------------------------- </P> <P>During the fourth quarter of 2009, we posted sales of <SPAN class=xn-money>$5.4 billion</SPAN>, an increase of 12% from the fourth quarter of 2008. This higher sales level was a result of increases in our North American, European and Rest of World production sales and complete vehicle assembly sales offset in part by a decrease in tooling, engineering and other sales. Comparing the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2008: </P><PRE>    -   North American average dollar content per vehicle decreased 1%, while\n        vehicle production increased 2%;\n    -   European average dollar content per vehicle increased 20%, and\n        vehicle production increased 13%; and\n    -   Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 7% to $512 million from\n        $479 million while complete vehicle assembly volumes declined 6%.\n\n\n</PRE> <P>During the fourth quarter of 2009, we generated an operating loss of <SPAN class=xn-money>$125 million</SPAN> compared to an operating loss of <SPAN class=xn-money>$165 million</SPAN> for 2008.

The increase in net income was a result of the increase in operating income partially offset by higher income taxes. </P> <P>During the fourth quarter of 2009, our diluted loss per share was <SPAN class=xn-money>$1.25</SPAN> compared to diluted loss per share of <SPAN class=xn-money>$1.33</SPAN> for the fourth quarter of 2008.

However, whether actual results and developments will conform with our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks, assumptions and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and the effects of which can be difficult to predict, including, without limitation: the potential for a slower than anticipated economic recovery or a deterioration of economic conditions; low production volumes and sales levels; the financial condition and credit worthiness of some of our OEM customers, including the potential that such customers may not make, or may seek to delay or reduce, payments owed to us; the financial condition of some of our suppliers and the risk of their insolvency, bankruptcy or financial restructuring; the highly competitive nature of the automotive parts supply business; our dependence on outsourcing by our customers; the termination or non renewal by our customers of any material contracts; our ability to identify and successfully exploit shifts in technology; restructuring, downsizing and/or other significant non- recurring costs; impairment charges; our ability to successfully grow our sales to non-traditional customers; unfavourable product or customer mix; risks of conducting business in foreign countries, including <SPAN class=xn-location>China</SPAN>, <SPAN class=xn-location>India</SPAN>, <SPAN class=xn-location>Brazil</SPAN>, <SPAN class=xn-location>Russia</SPAN> and other developing markets; our ability to quickly shift our manufacturing footprint to take advantage of lower cost manufacturing opportunities; disruptions in the capital and credit markets; fluctuations in relative currency values; our ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions; pricing pressures, including our ability to offset price concessions demanded by our customers; warranty and recall costs; product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage; changes in our mix of earnings between jurisdictions with lower tax rates and those with higher tax rates, as well as our ability to fully benefit tax losses; other potential tax exposures; legal claims against us; work stoppages and labour relations disputes; changes in laws and governmental regulations; costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations; potential conflicts of interest involving our indirect controlling shareholder, the Stronach Trust; and other factors set out in our Annual Information Form filed with securities commissions in <SPAN class=xn-location>Canada</SPAN> and our annual report on Form 40-F filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and subsequent filings. In evaluating forward-looking statements, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements and readers should specifically consider the various factors which could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. Unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, we do not intend, nor do we undertake any obligation, to update or revise any forward- looking statements to reflect subsequent information, events, results or circumstances or otherwise. </P> <P>MAGNA INTERNATIONAL INC.<BR>CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (LOSS) AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)<BR>(Unaudited)<BR>(U.S. dollars in millions, except per share figures)</P><PRE>                                     Three months ended        Year ended\n                                         December 31,          December 31,\n                                    --------------------  -------------------\n                             Note      2009       2008       2009       2008\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Sales                          $  5,419   $  4,836   $ 17,367   $ 23,704\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Costs and expenses\n      Cost of goods sold        8     4,844      4,447     15,697     20,982\n      Depreciation and\n       amortization                     201        209        737        873\n      Selling, general and\n       administrative          10       398        343      1,261      1,319\n      Interest (income)\n       expense, net                      (1)       (14)         7        (62)\n      Equity income                      (6)         -

BASIS OF PRESENTATION</P> <P>The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Magna International Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively \""Magna\"" or the \""Company\"") have been prepared in United States dollars following Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (\""GAAP\"") with respect to the preparation of interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required in the preparation of annual financial statements and therefore should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2008 audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's 2008 Annual Report. These interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the same accounting policies as the December 31, 2008 annual consolidated financial statements, except the Company retrospectively adopted the new Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants Handbook Section 3064, \""Goodwill and Intangible Assets\"", with no restatement of prior periods. The adoption of these recommendations had no material impact on the interim consolidated financial statements.</P> <P>In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which consist only of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position at December 31, 2009 and the results of operations and cash flows for the three-months and years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.</P> <P>2.

Based on the reporting unit's discounted forecast cashflows, the Company recorded a $25 million goodwill impairment charge.</P> <P>In addition, during the second quarter of 2009, after failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain facility in Syracuse, New York, the Company decided to wind down these operations. Given the significance of the facility's cashflows in relation to the reporting unit, management determined that it was more likely than not that goodwill at the Powertrain North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired. Therefore, the Company recorded a $75 million goodwill impairment charge.</P> <P>The goodwill impairment charges were calculated by determining the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if it had acquired the Powertrain and CTS reporting units as at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009, respectively.</P> <P>During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $13 million ($11 million after tax) related to fixed assets at a die casting facility in Canada and an anticipated under recovery of capitalized tooling costs at a stamping facility in the United States due to significantly lower volumes on certain SUV programs.</P> <P>During the second quarter of 2009, the Company recorded restructuring costs of $6 million in cost of goods sold ($6 million after tax) related to the planned closure of a powertrain facility in Syracuse, New York, substantially all of which will be paid subsequent to 2009.</P> <P>For the year ended December 31, 2008</P> <P>During 2008, the Company recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $275 million ($238 million after tax), related primarily to its powertrain and interior and exterior systems operations in the United States and Canada.</P> <P>At the Company's powertrain operations, particularly at a facility in Syracuse, New York, asset impairment charges of $189 million ($169 million after tax) were recorded primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic market shift away from truck programs, in particular four wheel drive pick-up trucks and SUVs; (iii) excess die-casting, machining and assembly capacity; and (iii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout the Company's business planning period.</P> <P>At its interiors and exteriors operations, the Company recorded $74 million ($61 million after tax) of asset impairment charges primarily as a result of: (i) significantly lower volumes on certain pick-up truck and SUV programs; (ii) the loss of certain replacement business; and (iii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout the Company's business planning period.</P> <P>During 2008, the Company recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $79 million in cost of goods sold and $5 million in selling, general and administrative expense ($60 million after tax) related to the above long-lived asset impairments and other restructuring activities. Substantially all of the $84 million was paid during 2009.</P> <P>(b) Europe</P> <P>For the year ended December 31, 2009</P> <P>During 2009, the Company recorded long-lived assets impairment charges of $70 million ($70 million after tax) related to its CTS and exterior systems operations in Germany.</P> <P>At the Company's CTS operations, long-lived asset impairment charges of $59 million ($59 million after tax) were recorded related to fixed and intangible assets. The impairment charge was calculated based on the CTS' discounted forecast cashflows and was necessary primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic reduction in the market for soft tops, hard tops and modular retractable hard tops; and (ii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout the Company's business planning period.</P> <P>At its exteriors operations, the Company recorded an $11 million ($11 million after tax) asset impairment charge related to specific under-utilized assets in Germany.</P> <P>During 2009, the Company recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $17 million in cost of goods sold and $3 million in selling, general and administrative expense ($20 million after tax). The charges consist primarily of severance and other termination benefits related to the closure of powertrain and interior systems facilities in Germany. Substantially all of the $20 million will be paid subsequent to 2009.</P> <P>For the year ended December 31, 2008</P> <P>During 2008, the Company recorded an $8 million ($8 million after tax) asset impairment related to the disposal of specific assets at an interior systems facility in the United Kingdom and specific assets at a powertrain facility in Austria.</P> <P>3.

ACQUISITIONS</P> <P>On May 11, 2009, Magna acquired Cadence Innovation s.r.o., a manufacturer of exterior and interior systems. The acquired business is primarily located in the Czech Republic with sales to various customers, including Skoda.</P> <P>On June 1, 2009, Magna acquired several facilities from Meridian Automotive Systems Inc. The facilities located in the United States and Mexico manufacture composites for various customers.</P> <P>The total consideration for these acquisitions and certain other acquisitions was $136 million, consisting of $50 million paid in cash and $86 million of assumed debt.</P> <P>The purchase price allocations for these acquisitions are preliminary and adjustments to the allocations may occur as a result of obtaining more information regarding asset valuations. On a preliminary basis, an allocation of the excess purchase price over the book value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been made to goodwill and intangible assets.</P> <P>5. INVESTMENTS</P> <P>At December 31, 2009, the Company held Canadian third party asset- backed commercial paper (\""ABCP\"") with a face value of Cdn$134 million and a carrying value of Cdn$88 million (December 31, 2008 - Cdn$79 million), which was based on a valuation technique that estimates the fair value based on relevant current market indices for instruments of comparable credit quality, term and structure (\""current market indices\"").</P> <P>During the third quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a $9 million increase in the carrying value of it's investment in ABCP in selling, general and administrative expense, due to a tightening of the spread between the anticipated return on the restructured notes and the current market indices.</P> <P>During 2008, the Company recorded a $41 million impairment charge (Q3 - $24 million; Q1 - $17 million) in selling, general and administrative expense. The impairment charge was calculated based on the anticipated return on the restructured notes (the \""Notes\"") versus the spreads using current market indices and a charge against potentially non-performing assets calculated on a probability weighted basis.</P> <P>Refer to note 8 of the Company's 2008 audited consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the significant estimates and assumptions incorporated into the valuation of our ABCP.</P> <P>6.

Accordingly, these estimated fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The estimated fair value amounts can be materially affected by the use of different assumptions or methodologies. The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments are described below:</P> <P>Cash and cash equivalents, bank indebtedness, accounts payable, accrued salaries and wages, other accrued liabilities and income taxes receivable.</P> <P>Due to the short period to maturity of the instruments, the carrying values as presented in the consolidated balance sheets are reasonable estimates of fair values.</P> <P>Investments</P> <P>At December 31, 2009, the Company held Canadian third party asset-backed commercial paper (\""ABCP\"") with a face value of Cdn$134 million. The carrying value and estimated fair value of this investment was Cdn$88 million (December 31, 2008 - Cdn$79 million). As fair value information is not readily determinable for the Company's investment in ABCP, the fair value was based on a valuation technique estimating the fair value from the perspective of a market participant.</P> <P>In addition, fair value information is not readily available for the Company's investment in equity accounted investees. However, management believes the market value to be in excess of the carrying value of these investments.</P> <P>Term debt</P> <P>The Company's term debt includes $16 million due within one year. Due to the short period to maturity of this debt, the carrying value as presented in the consolidated balance sheet is a reasonable estimate of its fair value. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt, based on the current rates for debt with similar terms and maturities, is not materially different from its carrying value.</P> <P>(c) Credit risk</P> <P>The Company's financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, held to maturity investments, and foreign exchange forward contracts with positive fair values.</P> <P>The Company's held for trading investments include an investment in ABCP. Given the continuing uncertainties regarding the value of the underlying assets, the amount and timing over cash flows and the risk of collateral calls in the event that spreads widened considerably, the Company could be exposed to further losses on its investment.</P> <P>Cash and cash equivalents, which consists of short-term investments, are only invested in governments, bank term deposits and bank commercial paper with an investment grade credit rating. Credit risk is further reduced by limiting the amount which is invested in certain governments or any major financial institution.</P> <P>The Company is also exposed to credit risk from the potential default by any of its counterparties on its foreign exchange forward contracts. The Company mitigates this credit risk by dealing with counterparties who are major financial institutions that the Company anticipates will satisfy their obligations under the contracts.</P> <P>In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to credit risk from its customers, substantially all of which are in the automotive industry and are subject to credit risks associated with the automotive industry. Sales to the Company's three largest customers, General Motors, BMW and Ford for the three months and year ended December 31, 2009 represented 47% and 49% of the Company's total sales, respectively.</P> <P>For the three months and year ended December 31, 2009, sales to the Company's six largest customers (including the Detroit 3) represented 81% and 82% of the Company's total sales, respectively, and substantially all of our sales are to customers in which the Company has ongoing contractual relationships.</P> <P>(d) Currency risk</P> <P>The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates when manufacturing facilities have committed to the delivery of products for which the selling price has been quoted in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency, or when materials and equipment are purchased in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency. In an effort to manage this net foreign exchange exposure, the Company employs hedging programs, primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts.</P> <P>As at December 31, 2009, the net foreign exchange exposure was not material.</P> <P>(e) Interest rate risk</P> <P>The Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk due to the short-term maturity of its monetary current assets and current liabilities. In particular, the amount of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents is impacted more by the investment decisions made and the demands to have available cash on hand, than by movements in the interest rates over a given period.</P> <P>In addition, the Company is not exposed to interest rate risk on its term debt instruments as the interest rates on these instruments are fixed."", ""PressReleaseImage"": null, ""PressReleaseThumb"": null, ""PressReleaseSquareThumb"": null, ""Category"": null, ""NewsType"": {""Subtaxa"": [], ""FullUrl"": ""/news-release"", ""Id"": ""a3920897-9088-41b3-8d6f-f78775888e08"", ""Name"": ""news-release"", ""UrlName"": [""n"", ""e"", ""w"", ""s"", ""-"", ""r"", ""e"", ""l"", ""e"", ""a"", ""s"", ""e""], ""Title"": [""N"", ""e"", ""w"", ""s"", "" "", ""R"", ""e"", ""l"", ""e"", ""a"", ""s"", ""e""], ""Description"": [], ""LastModified"": ""2017-10-30T13:11:57.493Z"", ""ShowInNavigation"": true, ""RenderAsLink"": true, ""ApplicationName"": ""Magna/"", ""ParentId"": ""00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"", ""AvailableLanguages"": ["""", ""en""], ""Status"": 0}, ""MagnaGroup"": null, ""Url"": ""/2010/02/25/press-release---magna-announces-fourth-quarter-and-2009-results"", ""PublicationDate"": ""2010-02-25T15:02:00Z"", ""LastModified"": ""2018-04-25T21:07:54.543Z"", ""DateCreated"": ""2011-10-05T01:13:05Z""}",2010-02-25,,Press Release - Magna announces fourth quarter and 2009 results,,/2010/02/25/press-release---magna-announces-fourth-quarter-and-2009-results,true,,"Please click HERE for a PDF version of the release. - Magna annonce ses résultats pour le quatrième trimestre et pour l'exercice 2009 - Magna gibt Finanzergebnis für viertes Quartal und Gesamtjahr 2009 bekanntAURORA, ON, Feb 25, 2010 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Magna International Inc.

 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 ---------------------------- We posted sales of $17.4 billion for 2009, a decrease of 27% from 2008. This lower sales level was a result of decreases in our North American and European production sales, complete vehicle assembly sales and tooling, engineering and other sales, offset in part by an increase in Rest of World production sales. External production sales in North America decreased 31% or $3.4 billion to $7.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $10.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease in production sales reflects a 32% decrease in North American vehicle production volumes partially offset by a 1% increase in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. External production sales in Europe decreased 17% or $1.2 billion to $5.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $7.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease in production sales reflects a 19% decrease in European vehicle production volumes partially offset by a 2% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. Complete vehicle assembly sales decreased 47% to $1.8 billion for 2009 compared to $3.3 billion for 2008, while complete vehicle assembly volumes declined 55% to approximately 57 thousand units. During 2009, operating loss was $511 million, net loss was $493 million and diluted loss per share was $4.41, decreases of $839 million, $564 million and $5.03, respectively, each compared to 2008. During 2009 and 2008, we recorded a number of unusual items, including impairment charges associated with goodwill, long-lived assets and future tax assets, restructuring charges, foreign currency gains, net losses on disposal of a facility, future tax charges and a curtailment gain. The aggregate charge to net income for 2009 and 2008 related to unusual items totalled $195 and $313 million, respectively. On a per share basis, the aggregate net charge for unusual items totalled $1.74 and $2.75 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, we generated cash from operations of $621 million before changes in non-cash operating assets and liabilities, and invested $94 million in non-cash operating assets and liabilities. Total investment activities for 2009 were $906 million, including $629 million in fixed asset additions, a $227 million increase in investments and other assets and $50 million to purchase subsidiaries. THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 ------------------------------------ We posted sales of $5.4 billion for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, an increase of 12% from the fourth quarter of 2008. This higher sales level was a result of increases in our North American, European and Rest of World production sales and complete vehicle assembly sales, offset in part by decreases in our tooling, engineering and other sales. External production sales in North America increased 1% or $24 million to $2.42 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $2.39 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase in production sales reflects a 2% increase in North American vehicle production volumes partially offset by a 1% decrease in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. External production sales in Europe increased 35% or $450 million to $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase in production sales reflects a 13% increase in European vehicle production volumes combined with a 20% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 7% to $512 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $479 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, while complete vehicle assembly volumes declined 6% to approximately 16,000 units. During the fourth quarter of 2009, operating loss was $125 million, net loss was $139 million and diluted loss per share was $1.25, increases of $40 million, $9 million and $0.08, respectively, each compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. During the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, we recorded a number of unusual items, including restructuring charges, impairment charges associated with goodwill and long-lived assets and a loss on disposal of a facility. The aggregate charge to net income for the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008 related to unusual items totalled $134 million and $72 million, respectively. On a per share basis, the aggregate net charge for unusual items for the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008 totalled $1.20 and $0.65, respectively. During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, we generated cash from operations of $267 million before changes in non-cash operating assets and liabilities, and generated $247 million from non-cash operating assets and liabilities. Total investment activities for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $259 million, including $230 million in fixed asset additions and a $29 million increase in other assets. A more detailed discussion of our consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2009 is contained in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Position and the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which are attached to this Press Release. UPDATED 2010 OUTLOOK -------------------- For the full year 2010, we expect our consolidated sales to be between $19 billion and $20 billion, based on full year 2010 light vehicle production volumes of approximately 10.5 million units in North America and approximately 11.4 million units in Europe. Full year 2010 average dollar content per vehicle is expected to be between $895 and $925 in North America and between $510 and $535 in Europe. We expect our full year 2010 complete vehicle assembly sales to be between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion. In addition, we expect that full year 2010 spending for fixed assets will be in the range of $750 million to $800 million. This 2010 outlook assumes no significant acquisitions or divestitures. In addition, we have assumed that foreign exchange rates for the most common currencies in which we conduct business relative to our U.S. dollar reporting currency will approximate current rates. We are the most diversified global automotive supplier. We design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced automotive systems, assemblies, modules and components, and engineer and assemble complete vehicles, primarily for sale to original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"") of cars and light trucks. Our capabilities include the design, engineering, testing and manufacture of automotive interior systems; seating systems; closure systems; body and chassis systems; vision systems; electronic systems; exterior systems; powertrain systems; roof systems; hybrid and electric vehicles/systems as well as complete vehicle engineering and assembly. We have approximately 72,500 employees in 238 manufacturing operations and 79 product development, engineering and sales centres in 25 countries. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- We will hold a conference call for interested analysts and shareholders to discuss our fourth quarter and year end results on Thursday, February 25, 2010 at 7:30 a.m. EST.

We design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced automotive systems, assemblies, modules and components, and engineer and assemble complete vehicles, primarily for sale to original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"") of cars and light trucks. Our capabilities include the design, engineering, testing and manufacture of automotive interior systems; seating systems; closure systems; body and chassis systems; vision systems; electronic systems; exterior systems; powertrain systems; roof systems; hybrid and electric vehicles/systems; as well as complete vehicle engineering and assembly. We follow a corporate policy of functional and operational decentralization, pursuant to which we conduct our operations through divisions, each of which is an autonomous business unit operating within pre-determined guidelines. As at December 31, 2009, we had 238 manufacturing divisions and 79 product development, engineering and sales centres in 25 countries. Our operations are segmented on a geographic basis between North America, Europe and Rest of World (primarily Asia, South America and Africa). A Co- Chief Executive Officer heads management in each of our two primary markets, North America and Europe. The role of the North American and European management teams is to manage our interests to ensure a coordinated effort across our different capabilities. In addition to maintaining key customer, supplier and government contacts in their respective markets, our regional management teams centrally manage key aspects of our operations while permitting our divisions enough flexibility through our decentralized structure to foster an entrepreneurial environment. HIGHLIGHTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- The automotive industry had a challenging year in 2009. The year began with weak global vehicle sales and production, most notably in the North American and Western European markets. In the first half of 2009, North American and Western European vehicle production declined 50% and 33%, respectively, as compared to the first half of 2008. The worsening economic and industry conditions which became apparent in the second half of 2008 accelerated the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of OEMs and suppliers, culminating in the bankruptcy filings of Chrysler and General Motors in April and June, respectively. During their respective periods under bankruptcy protection, vehicle production for Chrysler and General Motors was negligible. More generally, annualized vehicle sales in North America for the first half of 2009 remained at levels not experienced for more than 25 years. European vehicle sales and production, while down significantly from the previous year, were buoyed by a number of ""scrappage"" programs implemented by various European governments, which generally provided financial incentives for consumers to replace older, less fuel-efficient and typically higher polluting vehicles, with new vehicles, thereby stimulating vehicle sales. We began to see signs of improvement in the second half of 2009, particularly in North America. New vehicle selling rates strengthened, as consumer confidence levels increased and economic stimuli began to work their way through various economies. In North America, vehicle inventory days declined to levels which were below long term trend levels, due in part to production shut-downs and the positive effect of a vehicle scrappage program implemented in the United States. Nevertheless, by historical standards, full year vehicle sales and production in North America and Western Europe remained at low levels. North American vehicle production ended 2009 down 32%, as compared to 2008, marking the seventh straight year of declining production. Western European production declined 19% compared to 2008, despite the impact of the various scrappage programs. In 2009, we continued with restructuring and downsizing actions in order to mitigate the impact of continued production volume declines. We also undertook a number of other cost-saving measures, including reduced discretionary spending across the organization, employee reductions, short work week schedules, reduced bonuses, voluntary wage reductions and benefit plan changes. Despite these actions, the weak production environment adversely impacted our 2009 operating results. Total sales declined 27% in 2009, compared to 2008, primarily as a result of the declines in vehicle production in North America and Western Europe, along with a 47% decline in complete vehicle assembly sales and a 16% decline in tooling, engineering and other sales. Operating income for 2009 decreased $839 million, to a loss of $511 million, from income of $328 million in 2008. On the positive side, the severe industry conditions provided opportunities for us to strengthen our business relative to some of our competitors. We were successful in securing significant takeover business in 2009. We also completed selective acquisitions, including Cadence Innovation s.r.o, located primarily in the Czech Republic (""Cadence""), and several facilities in Mexico and the U.S. from Meridian Automotive Systems Inc. (""Meridian""). An additional bright spot was the continued growth of our business and manufacturing footprint outside our traditional markets of North America and Western Europe, which contributed to a 31% increase in Rest of World production sales, our eighth straight year of increasing production sales in this segment. During a period when several of our automotive supplier competitors ceased operations, were consolidated or experienced significant financial difficulties, our strong balance sheet and overall financial flexibility leading into the economic downturn, coupled with our financial discipline, cash flow generation and significant cash preservation and cost cutting efforts allowed us to preserve shareholder value and position us well to enhance such value in the future. Our strong financial position allows us to continue to invest in innovation. Notably, in the past few years, we have been investing to expand our capabilities and footprint in electronics. We see electronics as an area of future growth for the automotive industry and for Magna. More recently, we have been investing to develop our component, system and integration capabilities in the growing hybrid/electric vehicle market. However, we will need to further invest in both electronics and hybrid/electric vehicle systems before we generate appropriate returns from these investments. Our investments in these areas negatively impacted our earnings in 2009, and our planned investments in 2010 are expected to be higher. After a very turbulent year in many automotive markets, we expect global vehicle production to grow this year, led by growth in North America, provided that overall economic conditions continue to improve. Forecast growth in North American vehicle production would reverse the seven year slide experienced in this critical vehicle market. We are less optimistic about the near-term growth potential of the Western European market, which we believe will lag in 2010 due to the impact in 2009 of scrappage incentives which mitigated what would likely have been much weaker vehicle demand last year by ""pulling forward"" sales. FINANCIAL RESULTS SUMMARY ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During 2009, we posted sales of $17.4 billion, a decrease of 27% from 2008. This lower sales level was a result of decreases in our North American and European production sales, complete vehicle assembly sales and tooling, engineering and other sales offset in part by an increase in our Rest of World production sales. Comparing 2009 to 2008: - North American average dollar content per vehicle increased 1%, while
 vehicle production declined 32%;
 - European average dollar content per vehicle increased 2%, while
 vehicle production declined 19%; and
 - Complete vehicle assembly sales decreased 47% to $1.8 billion from
 $3.3 billion, as complete vehicle assembly volumes declined 55%.
 During 2009, we generated an operating loss of $511 million compared to operating income of $328 million for 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2009 and 2008, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, operating income declined $899 million. Included in operating income for 2009 and 2008 are several ""Significant Items"" that impact operating income representing approximately $220 million and $85 million, respectively. ""Significant Items"" consist primarily of: - downsizing and other restructuring activities that have not been
 included in the ""Unusual Items"" section;
 - accounts receivable valuation allowances recorded in 2009;
 - in 2009, a $9 million favourable adjustment (2008 - $41 million
 impairment) of our investment in ABCP as discussed in the ""Cash
 Resources"" section;
 - a favourable settlement on research and development incentives during
 2008;
 - due diligence costs associated with our planned investment in Opel,
 which terminated during 2009;
 - accelerated amortization of deferred wage buydown assets at a
 powertrain systems facility in the United States during 2008;
 - the write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related
 to the cancelation of an assembly program in the fourth quarter of
 2009;
 - costs related to the delay in the start of production of a program;
 and
 - other losses on disposal of assets.
 In addition, operating income was negatively impacted by: - decreased margin earned on reduced sales as a result of significantly
 lower vehicle production volumes;
 - costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches or for programs
 that have not fully ramped up production primarily in Europe;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities;
 - costs incurred at new facilities in Russia as we continue to pursue
 opportunities in this market;
 - electric vehicle development costs;
 - costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics capabilities;
 - higher commodity costs; and
 - net customer price concessions.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 savings initiatives (including reduced discretionary spending,
 employee reductions, short work week schedules, reduced bonuses,
 voluntary wage reductions and benefit plan changes), undertaken
 during or subsequent to 2008;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities; and
 - incremental margin earned from acquisitions completed during or
 subsequent to 2008.
 During 2009, net loss was $493 million compared to net income of $71 million for 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2009 and 2008, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income for 2009 decreased $682 million. The decrease in net income was a result of the decrease in operating income partially offset by lower income taxes. During 2009, our diluted loss per share was $4.41 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.62 for 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2009 and 2008, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, diluted earnings per share for 2009 decreased $6.04. The decrease in diluted earnings per share is as a result of the decrease in net income, excluding unusual items, and a decrease in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during 2009. The decrease in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to the effect of the repurchase and cancelation of Class A Subordinate Voting Shares in 2008 under the terms of our Normal Course Issuer Bid and a decrease in the number of diluted shares associated with restricted stock and stock options since such shares were anti-dilutive in 2009.

 (a) For the year ended December 31, 2009 (i) Goodwill In conjunction with the Company's annual business planning cycle, during the fourth quarter of 2009 we determined that our Car Top Systems (""CTS"") North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired, primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic reduction in the market for soft tops, hard tops and modular retractable hard tops; and (ii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout our business planning period. Based on the reporting unit's discounted forecast cashflows, we recorded a $25 million goodwill impairment charge. In addition, during the second quarter of 2009, after failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York, we decided to wind down these operations. Given the significance of the facility's cashflows in relation to the reporting unit, management determined that it was more likely than not that goodwill at the Powertrain North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired. Therefore, we recorded a $75 million goodwill impairment charge. The goodwill impairment charges were calculated by determining the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if we had acquired the Powertrain and CTS reporting units as at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009, respectively. (ii) Long-lived Assets Also in conjunction with our annual business planning cycle, during the fourth quarter of 2009 we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $83 million. In North America, we recorded charges of $13 million related to fixed assets at a die casting facility in Canada and an anticipated under recovery of capitalized tooling costs at a stamping facility in the United States due to significantly lower volumes on certain SUV programs. In Europe, we recorded long-lived assets impairment charges of $70 million related to our CTS and exterior systems operations in Germany. At our CTS operations, long-lived asset impairment charges of $59 million were recorded related to fixed and intangible assets. The impairment charge was calculated based on CTS' discounted forecast cashflows and was necessary primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic reduction in the market for soft tops, hard tops and modular retractable hard tops; and (ii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout our business planning period. At our interiors and exteriors operations, we recorded an $11 million asset impairment charge related to specific under-utilized assets in Germany. (iii) Restructuring Costs During 2009, we recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $23 million in cost of goods sold and $3 million in selling, general and administrative expense. During the second quarter, we recorded restructuring costs of $6 million related to the planned closure of a powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York and during the fourth quarter we recorded severance and other termination benefits related to the closure of powertrain and interior systems facilities in Germany. Substantially all of the $26 million will be paid subsequent to 2009. In addition, during 2009 and 2008, we incurred costs related to downsizing various operations in our traditional markets. (b) For the year ended December 31, 2008 (i) Long-lived Assets As a result of the significant and accelerated declines in vehicle production volumes, primarily in North America, we reviewed goodwill and long- lived assets for impairment during the third quarter of 2008. Based on this analysis, during 2008 we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $283 million related primarily to our powertrain, and interior and exterior systems operations in the United States and Canada. At our powertrain operations, particularly at a facility in Syracuse, New York, asset impairment charges of $189 million were recorded primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic market shift away from truck programs, in particular four wheel drive pick-up trucks and SUVs; (ii) excess die-casting, machining and assembly capacity; and (iii) historical losses that were projected to continue throughout our business planning period. At our interiors and exteriors operations, we recorded $74 million of asset impairment charges primarily as a result of: (i) significantly lower volumes on certain pick-up truck and SUV programs; (ii) the loss of certain replacement business; (iii) capacity utilization that is not sufficient to support the current overhead structure; and (iv) historical losses that were projected to continue throughout our business planning period. Additionally, in North America we recorded asset impairment charges of $12 million related to dedicated assets at a chassis systems facility in Canada and a seating systems facility in the United States. In Europe, we recorded an $8 million asset impairment related to specific assets at an interior systems facility in the United Kingdom and specific assets at a powertrain systems facility in Austria. (ii) Restructuring Charges During 2008, we recorded restructuring and rationalization costs in North America of $79 million in cost of goods sold and $5 million in selling, general and administrative expense. These restructuring and rationalization costs were primarily recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008 and relate to: (i) the consolidation of interiors and exteriors operations in Canada and the United States; (ii) the closure of a seating systems facility in St. Louis, Missouri; (iii) the consolidation of closure systems operations in Canada; and (iv) the consolidation of our powertrain die casting operations in Canada and the United States. During 2008, we also incurred costs related to downsizing various operations. (2) Sale of Facility During 2009, we entered into an agreement to sell an engineering centre in Europe and, as a result, incurred a loss on disposition of the facility of $8 million. (3) Foreign Currency Gains In the normal course of business, we review our cash investment and tax planning strategies, including where such funds are invested. As a result of these reviews, during the third quarter of 2008 we repatriated funds from Europe and as a result recorded foreign currency gains of $116 million. (4) Income Taxes During the third quarter of 2008, we recorded a $123 million charge to establish valuation allowances against all of our future tax assets in the United States. The valuation allowances were required in the United States based on historical consolidated losses at our U.S. operations, that were expected to continue in the near-term, the accelerated deterioration of near-term automotive market conditions in the United States and the significant and inherent uncertainty as to the timing of when we would be able to generate the necessary level of earnings to recover these future tax assets. (5) Curtailment gain During the second quarter of 2009, we amended our Retiree Premium Reimbursement Plan in Canada and the United States, such that most employees retiring on or after August 1, 2009 will no longer participate in the plan. The amendment will reduce service costs and retirement medical benefit expense in 2009 and future years. As a result of amending the plan, a curtailment gain of $26 million was recorded in cost of goods sold in the second quarter of 2009. INDUSTRY TRENDS AND RISKS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- With the apparent stabilization and improvement in the global automotive industry in the second half of 2009, a number of the trends which impacted the industry and our business beginning in the second half of 2008 appear to be diminishing. For example, vehicle production levels, particularly in North America, appear to be improving as compared to the low levels experienced in the second half of 2008 and first half of 2009. However, forecast vehicle production levels in both North America and Europe for 2010 remain significantly below historic averages and remain sensitive to continued improvement in overall economic conditions. Similarly, while the short-term viability of several of our customers has improved due to significant government intervention and restructuring actions, the long-term viability of certain of our customers remains uncertain. Continued improvement in the global automotive industry is heavily dependent on factors such as consumer confidence, employment levels, household debt, real estate values, the continued availability of consumer credit, interest rates, energy prices and other factors. At this time, it is too early to determine whether the apparent stabilization and improvement in the economy and automotive industry in the second half of 2009 will continue. The impact of other recent trends also remains uncertain. For example, as a result of the restructuring of the global automotive industry in 2008/2009, the financial condition of the automotive supply base deteriorated significantly, with a number of suppliers restructuring while under bankruptcy protection or ceasing operations altogether. In the short-term, we have secured a significant amount of takeover business as our customers transferred business from weak suppliers to stronger suppliers. However, the mid to long- term impact of the restructuring of the automotive supply base cannot be determined at this time. Some of our competitors have successfully emerged from bankruptcy restructurings, leaving them with strong balance sheets, reduced cost structures and improved overall competitiveness. One recent and growing trend in the automotive industry, born out of the need to carefully manage costs, is the growth of cooperative alliances and arrangements among competing automotive OEMs. New and increasing relationships include features such as: shared purchasing of components; joint engine, powertrain and/or platform development; and engine, powertrain and platform sharing. Cooperation among competing OEMs is expected to increase, particularly with respect to vehicle hybridization and electrification, in order to lower the entry cost for OEMs to compete in these vehicle segments. A number of general trends which have been impacting the automotive industry in recent years are expected to continue, including: - the exertion of pricing pressure by OEMs;
 - government incentives and consumer demand for, and industry focus on,
 more fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly vehicles with
 alternative-energy fuel systems and additional safety features;
 - governmental regulation of fuel economy and emissions;
 - the long-term growth of the automotive industry in China, India,
 Brazil, Russia and other developing markets, including accelerated
 migration of component and vehicle design, development, engineering
 and manufacturing to certain of these markets;
 - the growth of the A to D vehicle segments (micro to mid-size cars),
 particularly in developing markets; and
 - the consolidation of vehicle platforms.
 The following are some of the more significant risks that could affect our ability to achieve our desired results: - The global automotive industry is cyclical and is sensitive to
 changes in economic and political conditions, including interest
 rates, energy prices and international conflicts. Commencing in the
 second half of 2008, the automotive industry experienced a more
 severe cyclical downturn than in prior cycles due to the disruption
 of global credit markets beginning in September 2008, the
 corresponding reduction in access to credit (particularly for
 purposes of vehicle financing), the deterioration of housing and
 equity markets and the resulting erosion in personal net worth, all
 of which led to extremely low consumer confidence, particularly in
 the U.S and which in turn, severely impacted automotive sales. While
 the global economy is currently showing signs of improvement,
 uncertainty remains. As a result of restructuring actions taken by
 OEMs and suppliers during the most recent cyclical downturn,
 automotive production levels are more closely aligned with actual
 automotive sales levels and, accordingly, are sensitive to overall
 economic conditions. The continuation of current or lower production
 volumes and sales levels for an extended period of time could have a
 material adverse effect on our profitability.
 - While the global economy is currently experiencing a gradual recovery
 and the condition of the global automotive industry appears to have
 stabilized and improved beginning in the latter half of 2009,
 considerable uncertainty remains as to the breadth and depth of a
 global economic and industry recovery, including the timing of a
 return to more normal market conditions. As a result of this
 continued uncertainty, we remain subject to considerable planning
 risk with respect to our business. A slower than anticipated recovery
 or a deterioration of economic conditions could have a material
 adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.
 - The short-term viability of several of our OEM customers appears to
 have improved as a result of restructuring actions in the past few
 years, as well as extraordinary levels of government financial
 intervention in the automotive industry, particularly in 2009.
 However, there can be no assurance that these restructuring actions
 will be successful in ensuring their long- term viability, nor can
 there be any assurance that government financial assistance will be
 made available at levels necessary to prevent OEM failures in the
 future. The bankruptcy of any of our major customers could have a
 material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.
 Additionally, since OEMs rely on a highly interdependent network of
 suppliers, an OEM bankruptcy could materially disrupt the supply
 chain, which could have a material adverse effect on our
 profitability and financial condition.
 - We rely on a number of suppliers to supply us with a wide range of
 components required in connection with our business. While the
 automotive supply base appears to be stabilizing following the severe
 cyclical downturn which commenced in the second half of 2008, the
 financial health of automotive suppliers is impacted by economic
 conditions, production volume cuts, intense pricing pressures and
 other factors. The insolvency or bankruptcy of a supplier could
 disrupt the supply of components to us or our customers, potentially
 causing the temporary shut-down of our or our customers' production
 lines. Any prolonged disruption in the supply of critical components
 to us or our customers, the inability to re source or insource
 production of a critical component from a financially distressed
 automotive components sub-supplier, or any temporary shut-down of one
 of our production lines or the production lines of one of our
 customers, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
 Additionally, the insolvency, bankruptcy or financial restructuring
 of any of our critical suppliers could result in us incurring
 unrecoverable costs related to the financial work-out of such
 suppliers and/or increased exposure for product liability, warranty
 or recall costs relating to the components supplied by such suppliers
 to the extent such supplier is not able to assume responsibility for
 such amounts, which could have an adverse effect on our
 profitability.
 - The automotive parts supply industry is highly competitive. As a
 result of our diversified automotive business, we face a number of
 competitors possessing varying degrees of financial and operational
 strength in each our of product and service capabilities. Some of our
 competitors have a substantially greater market share than us and are
 dominant in some of the markets in which we do business. In addition,
 recent restructuring actions taken by some of our competitors have
 provided them with improved financial and operational flexibility and
 could increase their competitive threat to our business, including
 increasing their market share at our expense. We may not be able to
 compete successfully with our existing competitors or with any new
 competitors, which could have an adverse effect on our operations and
 profitability.
 - We are dependent on the outsourcing of components, modules and
 assemblies, as well as complete vehicles, by OEMs. The extent of OEM
 outsourcing is influenced by a number of factors, including relative
 cost, quality and timeliness of production by suppliers as compared
 to OEMs, capacity utilization, labour relations among OEMs, their
 employees and unions and other considerations. As a result of lower
 cost structures due to recent restructuring actions, some OEMs may
 insource production which had previously been outsourced. Outsourcing
 of complete vehicle assembly is particularly dependent on the degree
 of unutilized capacity at the OEMs' own assembly facilities, in
 addition to the foregoing factors. A reduction in outsourcing by
 OEMs, or the loss of any material production or assembly programs
 coupled with the failure to secure alternative programs with
 sufficient volumes and margins, could have a material adverse effect
 on our profitability.
 - We continue to invest in technology and innovation, including certain
 alternative-energy technologies which we believe will be critical to
 our long-term growth. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology
 and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products
 on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to
 remain competitive. If there is a shift away from the use of
 technologies in which we are investing, our costs may not be fully
 recovered. In addition, if other technologies in which our investment
 is not as great or our expertise is not as developed emerge as the
 industry-leading technologies, we may be placed at a competitive
 disadvantage, which could have a material adverse effect on our
 profitability and financial condition.
 - As part of our strategy of continuously seeking to optimize our
 global manufacturing footprint, we may further rationalize some of
 our production facilities. In the course of such rationalization, we
 may incur further restructuring and/or downsizing costs related to
 plant closings, relocations and employee severance costs. Such costs
 could have an adverse effect on our short-term profitability. In
 addition, we are working to turn around financially underperforming
 divisions; however, there is no guarantee that we will be successful
 in doing so with respect to some or all such divisions.
 - We recorded significant impairment charges related to goodwill, long-
 lived assets and future tax assets in recent years and may continue
 to do so in the future. The bankruptcy of a significant customer or
 the early termination, loss, renegotiation of the terms of, or delay
 in the implementation of any significant production contract could be
 indicators of impairment. In addition, to the extent that forward-
 looking assumptions regarding the impact of improvement plans on
 current operations, insourcing and other new business opportunities,
 program price and cost assumptions on current and future business,
 the timing of new program launches and forecast production volumes
 are not met, any resulting impairment loss could have a material
 adverse effect on our profitability.
 - Although we supply parts to all of the leading OEMs, a significant
 majority of our sales are to six such customers. While we have
 diversified our customer base somewhat in recent years and continue
 to attempt to further diversify, particularly to increase our
 business with Asian-based OEMs, there is no assurance we will be
 successful. Our inability to successfully grow our sales to non-
 traditional customers could have a material adverse effect on our
 profitability.
 - While we supply parts for a wide variety of vehicles produced in
 North America and Europe, we do not supply parts for all vehicles
 produced, nor is the number or value of parts evenly distributed
 among the vehicles for which we do supply parts. Shifts in market
 share among vehicles (including shifts away from vehicles we assemble
 or shifts away from specific parts we produce) or the early
 termination, loss, renegotiation of the terms of, or delay in the
 implementation of any significant production or assembly contract
 could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
 - Many of our customers have sought, and will likely continue to seek
 to take advantage of lower operating costs in China, India, Brazil,
 Russia and other developing markets. While we continue to expand our
 manufacturing footprint with a view to taking advantage of
 manufacturing opportunities in these markets, we cannot guarantee
 that we will be able to fully realize such opportunities.
 Additionally, the establishment of manufacturing operations in
 developing market countries carries its own risks, including those
 relating to political and economic instability; trade, customs and
 tax risks; currency exchange rates; currency controls; insufficient
 infrastructure; and other risks associated with conducting business
 internationally. The inability to quickly adjust our manufacturing
 footprint to take advantage of manufacturing opportunities in these
 markets could harm our ability to compete with other suppliers
 operating in or from such markets, which could have an adverse effect
 on our profitability.
 - Recently, several major financial institutions failed or required
 massive government intervention in order to prevent collapse. The
 turmoil in the financial sector significantly affected the global
 economy, and contributed to a global recession. While financial
 markets appear to have stabilized, the failure of any major financial
 institutions in the future could lead to significant disruptions in
 capital and credit markets and could adversely affect our and our
 customers' ability to access needed liquidity for working capital. In
 addition, in the event of a failure of a financial institution; in
 which we invest our cash reserves; that is a counterparty in a
 derivative transaction with us; or a lender to us, we face the risk
 that that our cash reserves and amounts owing to us pursuant to
 derivative transactions may not be fully recoverable, or the amount
 of credit available to us may be significantly reduced. All of these
 risks could have an impact on our financial condition.
 - Although our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a
 significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in
 Canadian dollars, euros, British pounds and other currencies. Our
 profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against the
 Canadian dollar, the euro, the British pound and other currencies in
 which we generate revenues and incur expenses. However, as a result
 of hedging programs employed by us, foreign currency transactions are
 not fully impacted by movements in exchange rates. We record foreign
 currency transactions at the hedged rate where applicable. Despite
 these measures, significant long-term fluctuations in relative
 currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative
 values of the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, euro or British pound,
 could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial
 condition and any sustained change in such related currency values
 could adversely impact our competitiveness in certain geographic
 regions.
 - We have completed a number of significant acquisitions in recent
 years and may continue to do so in the future. In those product areas
 in which we have identified acquisitions as critical to our business
 strategy, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition targets
 or successfully acquire any suitable targets which we identify.
 Additionally, we may not be able to successfully integrate or achieve
 anticipated synergies from those acquisitions which we do complete
 and such failure could have a material adverse effect on our
 profitability.
 - We face significant pricing pressure, as well as pressure to absorb
 costs related to product design, engineering and tooling, as well as
 other items previously paid for directly by OEMs. These pressures are
 expected to continue, even as the industry begins to recover from the
 global recession. The continuation or intensification of these
 pricing pressures and pressure to absorb costs could have an adverse
 effect on our profitability.
 - Our customers continue to demand that we bear the cost of the repair
 and replacement of defective products which are either covered under
 their warranty or are the subject of a recall by them. Warranty
 provisions are established based on our best estimate of the amounts
 necessary to settle existing or probable claims on product defect
 issues. Recall costs are costs incurred when government regulators
 and/or our customers decide to recall a product due to a known or
 suspected performance issue and we are required to participate either
 voluntarily or involuntarily. Currently, under most customer
 agreements, we only account for existing or probable warranty claims.
 Under certain complete vehicle engineering and assembly contracts, we
 record an estimate of future warranty-related costs based on the
 terms of the specific customer agreements and the specific customer's
 warranty experience. The obligation to repair or replace such
 products could have a material adverse effect on our profitability
 and financial condition if the actual costs are materially different
 from our estimates.
 - From time to time, we may become liable for legal, contractual and
 other claims by various parties, including customers, suppliers,
 former employees, class action plaintiffs and others. On an on going
 basis, we attempt to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments
 or outcomes to these claims, although it is difficult to predict
 final outcomes with any degree of certainty. At this time, we do not
 believe that any of the claims to which we are party will have a
 material adverse effect on our financial position; however, we cannot
 provide any assurance to this effect. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Average Foreign Exchange

 The preceding table reflects the average foreign exchange rates between the most common currencies in which we conduct business and our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The significant changes in these foreign exchange rates for the three months and year ended December 31, 2009 impacted the reported U.S. dollar amounts of our sales, expenses and income. The results of operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates in the table above for the relevant period. Throughout this MD&A, reference is made to the impact of translation of foreign operations on reported U.S. dollar amounts where relevant. Our results can also be affected by the impact of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency transactions (such as raw material purchases or sales denominated in foreign currencies). However, as a result of hedging programs employed by us, foreign currency transactions in the current period have not been fully impacted by movements in exchange rates. We record foreign currency transactions at the hedged rate where applicable. Finally, holding gains and losses on foreign currency denominated monetary items, which are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, impact reported results.

 External Production Sales - North America External production sales in North America decreased 31% or $3.4 billion to $7.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $10.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease in production sales reflects a 32% decrease in North American vehicle production volumes partially offset by a 1% increase in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. More importantly, during 2009 our largest customers in North America continued to reduce vehicle production volumes compared to 2008. While North American vehicle production volumes declined 32% in 2009 compared to 2008, Chrysler and GM vehicle production declined 48% and 44%, respectively. On a positive note, Ford's vehicle production decline was only 16%. Our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 1% or $5 to $872 for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $867 for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to 2008, including
 the:
 - Ford F-Series and Lincoln Mark LT;
 - Chevrolet Traverse;
 - Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain; and
 - Chevrolet Camaro;
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or increased
 content on certain programs, including the:
 - Ford Escape, Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute; and
 - Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan and Lincoln MKZ;
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to 2008, including
 - a substantial portion of Plastech Engineered Products Inc.'s
 exteriors business (""Plastech"");
 - Meridian; and
 - a stamping and sub-assembly facility in Alabama from Ogihara
 America Corporation; and
 - takeover business that launched during or subsequent to 2008.
 These factors were partially offset by: - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or lower
 content on certain programs, including the:
 - Chevrolet Cobalt;
 - Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and Volkswagen
 Routan;
 - Chrysler 300 and 300C and Dodge Charger; and
 - Buick Enclave and GMC Acadia;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to 2008,
 including the:
 - Saturn Vue, Aura and Outlook;
 - Chevrolet Trailblazer and GMC Envoy; and
 - Pontiac G5, G6, Solstice, Sky and GT;
 - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the
 Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar; and
 - customer price concessions during or subsequent to 2008.
 External Production Sales - Europe External production sales in Europe decreased 17% or $1.2 billion to $5.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $7.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease in production sales reflects a 19% decrease in European vehicle production volumes partially offset by a 2% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. Our average dollar content per vehicle increased by 2% or $9 to $495 for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $486 for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to 2008, including
 the:
 - Audi Q5;
 - Volkswagen Golf;
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Opel/Vauxhall Insignia;
 - BMW One/Cooper Convertible; and
 - Volkswagen A5 Cabrio and Sportback; and
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to 2008, including
 Cadence.
 These factors were partially offset by: - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or lower
 content on certain programs, including the:
 - Mercedes-Benz C-Class;
 - Porsche Cayenne and Volkswagen Touareg;
 - Volkswagen Transporter;
 - BMW X3;
 - Ford Transit;
 - Opel/Vauxhall Vivaro, Nissan Primastar and Renault Trafic;
 - Opel Astra;
 - Audi Q7; and
 - Honda Civic;
 - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the
 euro and British pound, each against the U.S. dollar;
 - the sale of certain facilities during or subsequent to 2008; and
 - customer price concessions during or subsequent to 2008.
 External Production Sales - Rest of World External production sales in Rest of World increased 31% or $161 million to $676 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $515 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of: - increased production and/or content on certain programs in China and
 Brazil;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to 2008 in China and
 Japan; and
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales as a result of the
 strengthening of the Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. dollar.
 These factors were partially offset by: - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales as a result of the weakening
 of the Brazilian real, Korean Won and South African Rand, each
 against the U.S. dollar; and
 - decreased production and/or content on certain programs, particularly
 in South Africa.
 Complete Vehicle Assembly Sales The terms of our various vehicle assembly contracts differ with respect to the ownership of components and supplies related to the assembly process and the method of determining the selling price to the OEM customer. Under certain contracts we are acting as principal and purchased components and systems in assembled vehicles are included in our inventory and cost of sales. These costs are reflected on a full cost basis in the selling price of the final assembled vehicle to the OEM customer. Other contracts provide that third-party components and systems are held on consignment by us, and the selling price to the OEM customer reflects a value added assembly fee only. Production levels of the various vehicles assembled by us have an impact on the level of our sales and profitability. In addition, the relative proportion of programs accounted for on a full cost basis and programs accounted for on a value added basis also impacts our level of sales and operating margin percentage, but may not necessarily affect our overall level of profitability. Assuming no change in total vehicles assembled, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a full cost basis has the effect of increasing the level of total sales, however, because purchased components are included in cost of sales, profitability as a percentage of total sales is reduced. Conversely, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a value added basis has the effect of reducing the level of total sales and increasing profitability as a percentage of total sales.

 Complete vehicle assembly sales decreased 47% or $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 while assembly volumes decreased 55% or 68,816 units. The decrease in complete vehicle assembly volumes is due to a combination of general economic conditions as discussed previously; the natural decline in volumes as certain models that we currently assemble approach their scheduled end of production; and a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. However, the Peugeot RCZ launched in the fourth quarter of 2009 and several new complete vehicle assembly programs have been awarded and are scheduled to launch throughout 2010 to 2013. Tooling, Engineering and Other Tooling, engineering and other sales decreased 16% or $0.3 billion to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. In the year ended December 31, 2009, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - MINI Cooper, Clubman and Crossman;
 - Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra;
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Opel/Vauxhall Astra;
 - Audi Q5;
 - BMW X3;
 - Porsche Boxster and Cayman;
 - Porsche Cayenne;
 - Mercedes-Benz M-Class;
 - Peugeot RCZ;
 - Cadillac SRX and Saab 9-4X;
 - Ford F-Series; and
 - Mercedes-Benz C-Class.
 In the year ended December 31, 2008, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - MINI Cooper, Clubman and Crossman;
 - BMW Z4, X3 and 1-Series;
 - GM's full-size pickups;
 - Cadillac SRX and Saab 9-4X;
 - Mazda 6;
 - Porsche 911 / Boxster;
 - Mercedes-Benz M-Class;
 - Chevrolet Equinox, Pontiac Torrent and Suzuki XL7;
 - Ford F-Series;
 - Lincoln MKS; and
 - Audi A5.
 In addition, tooling, engineering and other sales decreased as a result of the weakening of the euro and Canadian dollar, each against the U.S. dollar. Gross Margin Gross margin decreased $1.0 billion to $1.7 billion for 2009 compared to $2.7 billion for 2008 while gross margin as a percentage of total sales decreased to 9.6% for 2009 compared to 11.5% for 2008. The unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section negatively impacted gross margin as a percentage of total sales in 2008 by 0.3%. Excluding unusual items, gross margin as a percentage of total sales decreased by 2.2%. ""Significant Items"" also negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $125 million and $70 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, gross margin as a percentage of total sales was negatively impacted by: - lower gross margin earned due to the significant decline in vehicle
 production volumes;
 - costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches primarily in
 Europe;
 - electric vehicle development costs;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities;
 - a favourable revaluation of warranty accruals during 2008;
 - costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics capabilities;
 - additional supplier insolvency costs;
 - increased commodity costs; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2008.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives (including employee reductions, short work week
 schedules and benefit plan changes) undertaken during or subsequent
 to 2008;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - a decrease in complete vehicle assembly sales which have a lower
 gross margin than our consolidated average;
 - no employee profit sharing for 2009; and
 - the decrease in tooling and other sales that earn low or no margins.
 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization costs decreased 16% or $136 million to $737 million for 2009 compared to $873 million for 2008. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily as a result of: - the impairment of certain assets during 2008, in particular at a
 powertrain systems facility in the United States and certain
 interiors and exteriors systems facilities in North America;
 - the sale or disposition of certain facilities during or subsequent to
 2008; and
 - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar depreciation and amortization due
 to the weakening of the Canadian dollar and euro, each against the
 U.S. dollar.
 These factors were partially offset by acquisitions and capital spending during or subsequent to 2008. Selling, General and Administrative (""SG&A"") SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 7.3% for 2009, compared to 5.6% for 2008. The unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section negatively impacted SG&A as a percentage of total sales in 2009 by 0.1% and positively impacted SG&A as a percentage of total sales in 2008 by 0.4%. Excluding these unusual items, SG&A as a percentage of total sales increased 1.2%. SG&A expense decreased 4% or $58 million to $1.26 billion for 2009 compared to $1.32 billion for 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2009 and 2008 (as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section), SG&A expenses decreased by $180 million. ""Significant Items"" also negatively impacted SG&A by approximately $95 million and $15 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, SG&A was positively impacted by: - cost saving initiatives, including reduced discretionary spending,
 employee reductions, reduced bonuses, voluntary wage reductions and
 benefit plan changes;
 - reduced spending at certain facilities as a result of restructuring
 and downsizing activities that were initiated during or subsequent
 to 2008;
 - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar SG&A expense due to the weakening
 of the Canadian dollar and euro, each against the U.S. dollar; and
 - the sale or disposition of certain facilities during or subsequent to
 2008.
 These factors were partially offset by acquisitions completed during or subsequent to 2008, including Cadence. Impairment Charges Impairment charges decreased $100 million to $183 million for 2009 compared to $283 million for 2008 as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) EBIT is defined as income (loss) from operations before income taxes as presented on our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements before net interest expense (income). North America EBIT in North America decreased $7 million to a loss of $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to a loss of $106 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Excluding the North American unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $273 million decrease in EBIT was substantially due to decreased margins earned on reduced sales as a result of significantly lower vehicle production volumes. ""Significant Items"" including, downsizing and other restructuring activities; accelerated amortization of deferred wage buydown assets; and settlement on research and development incentives also negatively impacted EBIT in North America by approximately $85 million and $40 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, EBIT was negatively impacted by: - electric vehicle development costs;
 - additional supplier insolvency costs;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics capabilities;
 - higher warranty costs; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2008.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives (including reduced discretionary spending,
 employee reductions, reduced bonuses, and benefit plan changes)
 undertaken during or subsequent to 2008;
 - lower affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - no employee profit sharing for 2009;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities; and
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition from Plastech.
 Europe EBIT in Europe decreased $656 million to a loss of $415 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to earnings of $241 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Excluding the European unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $566 million decrease in EBIT was substantially due to decreased margins earned on reduced sales as a result of significantly lower vehicle production volumes. ""Significant Items"" including, downsizing and other restructuring activities; accounts receivable valuation allowances; write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related to the cancelation of an assembly program; and costs related to the delay in the start of production in a program also negatively impacted EBIT in Europe by approximately $110 million and $5 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, EBIT was negatively impacted by: - costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches or for programs
 that have not fully ramped up production;
 - costs incurred at new facilities in Russia as we continue to pursue
 opportunities in this market;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities;
 - a favourable revaluation of warranty accruals during 2008;
 - costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics capabilities; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2008.
 These factors were partially offset by: - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence;
 - lower affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - the benefit of cost saving initiatives, including reduced
 discretionary spending, employee reductions, short work week
 schedules, reduced bonuses and voluntary wage reductions;
 - lower commodity costs; and
 - the sale of certain underperforming divisions during or subsequent to
 2008.
 Rest of World EBIT in Rest of World increased $11 million to $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of incremental margin earned on new programs that launched during or subsequent to 2008 in China partially offset by costs incurred at new facilities, substantially in India and Japan. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other EBIT decreased $118 million to a loss of $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to earnings of $99 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Excluding the Corporate and Other unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, EBIT decreased by $2 million. ""Significant Items"" including, due diligence costs associated with our planned investment in Opel, which terminated during the fourth quarter of 2009; adjustments of our investment in ABCP; and other losses on disposal of assets also negatively impacted EBIT in Corporate and Other by approximately $25 million and $40 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, EBIT was negatively impacted by: - a decrease in affiliation fees earned from our divisions; and
 - a decrease in equity income earned.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the benefit of cost saving initiatives, including reduced
 discretionary spending, employee reductions, short work week
 schedules, reduced bonuses, voluntary wage reductions and benefit
 plan changes;
 - decreased executive compensation;
 - costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to electric
 vehicle development; and
 - lower charitable and social contributions.
 Interest Expense (Income), net During 2009, we recorded net interest expense of $7 million, compared to $62 million of net interest income for 2008. The $69 million decrease in net interest income is as a result of: - a decrease in interest income earned on lower cash and cash
 equivalent balances;
 - a decrease in interest income earned due to lower interest rates; and
 - an increase in interest expense paid on higher short-term borrowings.
 These factors were partially offset by a reduction in interest expense on long-term debt due to the repayment of our senior unsecured notes and 7.08% Subordinated Debentures. Operating Income (Loss) Operating income decreased $839 million to a loss of $511 million for 2009 compared to income of $328 million for 2008. Excluding the unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, operating income for 2009 decreased $899 million. The decrease in operating income is the result of the decreases in EBIT (including the approximately $145 million of additional ""Significant Items"" in 2009) and net interest income earned, both as discussed above. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate on operating income (excluding equity income) for 2009 and 2008 was significantly impacted by the unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section. Excluding unusual items, our effective income tax rate changed to a recovery of 6.7% for 2009 compared to an expense of 34.8% for 2008. The change in the effective income tax rate is primarily the result of an increase in losses not benefited primarily in Germany and Austria. Net Income (Loss) Net income decreased $564 million to a net loss of $493 million for 2009 compared to net income of $71 million for 2008. Excluding the unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income decreased $682 million. This decrease in net income is the result of the decrease in operating income partially offset by lower income taxes, both as discussed above. Earnings (Loss) per Share For the year

Excluding the unusual items, discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, diluted earnings per share decreased $6.04 from 2008 as a result of a decrease in net income (excluding unusual items) described above and a decrease in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during 2009. The decrease in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to the effect of the repurchase and cancelation of our Class A Subordinate Voting Shares in 2008 under the terms of our Normal Course Issuer Bid and a decrease in the number of diluted shares associated with restricted stock and stock options since such shares were anti-dilutive in 2009.

 Cash flow from operations before changes in non-cash operating assets and liabilities decreased $708 million to $621 million for 2009 compared to $1.3 billion for 2008. The decrease in cash flow from operations was primarily due to the $564 million decrease in net income, as discussed above, and a $223 million decrease in non-cash unusual items, $136 million reduction in depreciation and amortization offset in part by a $187 million increase in future taxes. Cash invested in non-cash operating assets and liabilities amounted to $94 million for 2009 compared to $275 million for 2008. The change in non-cash operating assets and liabilities is comprised of the following sources (and uses) of cash: For the year

 Changes in non-cash operating assets and liabilities $ (94) $ (275)

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable in 2009 was primarily due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in inventories relates to several tooling programs in North America and Europe and depletion of production inventory builds due to increased production volumes. The increase in income taxes receivable was primarily due to losses that are being carried back to prior years and higher refunds in North America. The decrease in other accrued liabilities is primarily a result of the payments during 2009 of restructuring costs that were accrued as at December 31, 2008.

 Fixed and other assets additions In 2009, we invested $629 million in fixed assets. While investments were made to refurbish or replace assets consumed in the normal course of business and for productivity improvements, a large portion of the investment in 2009 was for manufacturing equipment for programs that will be launching subsequent to 2009. In 2009, we invested $227 million in other assets related substantially to fully reimbursable planning and engineering and tooling costs at our complete vehicle engineering and assembly operations and our roof systems operations for programs that will be launching subsequent to 2009. Purchase of subsidiaries During 2009, we invested $50 million to purchase subsidiaries, including the acquisition of: - Cadence, a manufacturer of exterior and interior systems. The
 acquired business is primarily located in the Czech Republic with
 sales to various customers, including Skoda; and
 - several facilities from Meridian. The facilities are located in the
 United States and Mexico and manufacture composites for various
 customers.
 During 2008, we invested $158 million to purchase subsidiaries, including the acquisition of: - a facility from Ogihara America Corporation;
 - a substantial portion of the exteriors business and related assets
 from Plastech;
 - BluWav Systems LLC; and
 - Technoplast.
 Proceeds from disposition Proceeds from disposition in 2009 and 2008 were $30 million and $65 million, respectively, which represent normal course fixed and other asset disposals. Financing For the year

 In December 2008, in response to the uncertainty related to the financial viability of some of our key customers in North America, we drew down on our term and operating lines of credit. In February and March 2009, as the situation facing some of our key customers became clearer, we repaid $767 million of the outstanding lines of credit. The repayments of debt in 2009 consists primarily of the repayment of our 7.08% Subordinated Debentures in September 2009 and our 6.5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures in December 2009. During 2009, cash dividends of $21 million were paid on the Class A Subordinate Voting or Class B Shares in the first quarter of 2009. This compares to cash dividends of $140 million in 2008. During the second quarter of 2009, our Board of Directors suspended payment of dividends and, as a result, no cash dividends were paid on our Class A Subordinate Voting or Class B Shares for the remainder of 2009.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Total capitalization decreased by $1.03 billion to $7.54 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to $8.57 billion at December 31, 2008. The decrease in capitalization was a result of a $1.03 billion decrease in liabilities. The decrease in liabilities is primarily as a result of a $767 million repayment on our outstanding lines of credit in the first quarter of 2009, the repayment of our 7.08% Subordinated Debentures during the third quarter of 2009 and the repayment of our 6.5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures during the fourth quarter of 2009. These decreases were partially offset by debt assumed on the acquisition of Cadence. The decrease in shareholders' equity was primarily as a result of: - the net loss incurred during 2009; and
 - dividends paid during the first quarter of 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by: - a $407 million increase in accumulated net unrealized gains on
 translation of our net investment in foreign operations, primarily
 as a result of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, euro and
 British pound, each against the U.S. dollar between December 31,
 2008 and December 31, 2009; and
 - net unrealized gains on cash flow hedges and the reclassification of
 net losses on cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive
 income to net loss.
 Cash Resources During 2009, our cash resources decreased by $1.4 billion to $1.3 billion primarily as a result of the net repayment of $0.9 billion on our outstanding lines of credit, cash used in investing activities, the repayment of our 7.08% Subordinated Debentures and the repayment of our 6.5% Convertible Subordinate Debentures, all as discussed previously. In addition to our cash resources, we had term and operating lines of credit totalling $2.1 billion. The unused and available portion of our lines of credit increased $0.9 billion to $1.9 billion during 2009 due to the net repayment on our operating lines. In addition, at December 31, 2009, we held Canadian third party ABCP with a face value of Cdn$134 million and a carrying value of Cdn$88 million, which was based on a valuation technique that estimates the fair value based on relevant current market indices for instruments of comparable credit quality, term and structure (""current market indices""). During 2009, we recorded a $9 million increase in the carrying value of our investment in ABCP due to a tightening of the spread between the anticipated return on the restructured notes and the current market indices.

 Our off balance sheet financing arrangements are limited to operating lease contracts. The majority of our facilities are subject to operating leases with MID or with third parties. Operating lease payments in 2009 for facilities leased from MID and third parties were $149 million and $131 million, respectively. Operating lease commitments in 2010 for facilities leased from MID and third parties are expected to be $150 million and $128 million, respectively. Our existing leases with MID generally provide for periodic rent escalations based either on fixed-rate step increases, or on the basis of a consumer price index adjustment (subject to certain caps). We also have operating lease commitments for equipment. These leases are generally of shorter duration. Operating lease payments for equipment were $42 million for 2009, and are expected to be $41 million in 2010. Although our consolidated contractual annual lease commitments decline year by year, we expect that existing leases will either be renewed or replaced, or alternatively, we will incur capital expenditures to acquire equivalent capacity. Foreign Currency Activities Our North American operations negotiate sales contracts with OEMs for payment in both U.S. and Canadian dollars. Materials and equipment are purchased in various currencies depending upon competitive factors, including relative currency values. The North American operations use labour and materials which are paid for in both U.S. and Canadian dollars. Our Mexican operations generally use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. Our European operations negotiate sales contracts with OEMs for payment principally in euros and British pounds. The European operations' material, equipment and labour are paid for principally in euros and British pounds. We employ hedging programs, primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts, in an effort to manage our foreign exchange exposure, which arises when manufacturing facilities have committed to the delivery of products for which the selling price has been quoted in foreign currencies. These commitments represent our contractual obligations to deliver products over the duration of the product programs, which can last a number of years. The amount and timing of the forward contracts will be dependent upon a number of factors, including anticipated production delivery schedules and anticipated production costs, which may be paid in the foreign currency. In addition, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign exchange exposure with respect to internal funding arrangements. Despite these measures, significant long term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative values of the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, euro or British pound, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition (as discussed throughout this MD&A). RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- FINANCIAL RESULTS SUMMARY ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the fourth quarter of 2009, we posted sales of $5.4 billion, an increase of 12% from the fourth quarter of 2008. This higher sales level was a result of increases in our North American, European and Rest of World production sales and complete vehicle assembly sales offset in part by a decrease in tooling, engineering and other sales. Comparing the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2008: - North American average dollar content per vehicle decreased 1%, while
 vehicle production increased 2%;
 - European average dollar content per vehicle increased 20%, and
 vehicle production increased 13%; and
 - Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 7% to $512 million from
 $479 million while complete vehicle assembly volumes declined 6%.
 During the fourth quarter of 2009, we generated an operating loss of $125 million compared to an operating loss of $165 million for 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, operating income increased by $80 million. Included in operating income for the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008 are several ""Significant Items"" that impact operating income representing approximately $130 million and $20 million, respectively. ""Significant Items"" consist primarily of: - downsizing and other restructuring activities that have not been
 included in the ""Unusual Items"" section;
 - an accounts receivable valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of
 2009;
 - due diligence costs associated with our planned investment in Opel,
 which terminated during the fourth quarter of 2009;
 - the write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related
 to the cancelation of an assembly program in the fourth quarter of
 2009;
 - costs related to the delay in the start of production of a program;
 and
 - other losses on disposal of assets.
 During the fourth quarter of 2009, net loss was $139 million compared to net loss of $148 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income for the fourth quarter 2009 increased $71 million. The increase in net income was a result of the increase in operating income partially offset by higher income taxes. During the fourth quarter of 2009, our diluted loss per share was $1.25 compared to diluted loss per share of $1.33 for the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, diluted loss per share for 2009 decreased $0.63. The decrease in diluted loss per share is primarily as a result of the increase in net income, excluding unusual items. For the three months

 External Production Sales - North America External production sales in North America increased 1% or $24 million to $2.42 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $2.39 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase in production sales reflects a 2% increase in North American vehicle production volumes partially offset by a 1% decrease in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. Our average dollar content per vehicle declined by 1% or $6 to $868 for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $874 for the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of: - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or lower
 content on certain programs, including the:
 - GM full-sized pickups;
 - Chevrolet Cobalt;
 - GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave;
 - Chevrolet Impala;
 - Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and Volkswagen
 Routan;
 - Chevrolet HHR;
 - Mazda 6;
 - Dodge Ram; and
 - Chrysler 300 and 300C and Dodge Charger; and
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the fourth
 quarter of 2008, including the:
 - Pontiac G5, G6, Solstice, Sky and GT;
 - Chevrolet Trailblazer, GMC Envoy and Saab 9-7X; and
 - Saturn Vue, Aura and Outlook; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the fourth quarter of
 2008.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the fourth quarter
 of 2008, including the:
 - Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Terrain, Pontiac Torrent and Suzuki XL7;
 - Cadillac SRX; and
 - Chevrolet Camaro;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening
 of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar;
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or increased
 content on certain programs, including the:
 - Ford Escape, Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute; and
 - Ford F-Series and Lincoln Mark LT;
 - takeover business that launched subsequent to the fourth quarter
 of 2008; and
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to the fourth quarter
 of 2008, including several facilities from Meridian.
 External Production Sales - Europe External production sales in Europe increased 35% or $450 million to $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase in production sales reflects a 13% increase in European vehicle production volumes as discussed in the ""Highlights"" section combined with a 20% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. Our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 20% or $87 to $523 for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $436 for the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily as a result of: - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening of
 the euro and British pound, each against the U.S. dollar;
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to the fourth quarter of
 2008, including Cadence; and
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the fourth quarter
 of 2008, including the:
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Skoda Yeti;
 - MINI Cooper Convertible; and
 - Audi A5 Cabrio and Sportback;
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or increased
 content on certain programs, including the Audi Q5.
 These factors were partially offset by: - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or lower
 content on certain programs, including the:
 - Volkswagen Transporter;
 - Smart fortwo;
 - Mercedes-Benz C-Class;
 - BMW X3;
 - Mercedes-Benz B-Class and B-Class Fuel Cell; and
 - Volkswagen Tiguan;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the fourth
 quarter of 2008, including the GAZ Siber; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the fourth quarter of
 2008.
 External Production Sales - Rest of World External production sales in Rest of World increased 115% or $118 million to $221 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $103 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of: - increased production and/or content on certain programs in China,
 Korea and Brazil;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the fourth quarter
 of 2008 in China and Japan; and
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales as a result of the
 weakening of the Brazilian real and Korean won, each against the
 U.S. dollar.

 Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 7% or $33 million to $512 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $479 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 and assembly volumes decreased 6% or 1,081 units. The higher sales level is primarily as a result of an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar partially offset by the decrease in complete vehicle assembly volumes due to the natural decline in volumes as certain models that we currently assemble approach their scheduled end of production. However, the Peugeot RCZ launched in the fourth quarter of 2009 and several new complete vehicle assembly programs have been awarded and are scheduled to launch throughout 2010 to 2013. Tooling, Engineering and Other Tooling, engineering and other sales decreased 7% or $42 million to $547 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $589 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - Audi Q5;
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Porsche Boxster and Cayman;
 - Mercedes-Benz M-Class;
 - Porsche Cayenne;
 - Peugeot RCZ;
 - MINI Cooper, Clubman and Crossman;
 - Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra;
 - BMW X3; and
 - Mercedes-Benz E-Class.
 In the fourth quarter of 2008, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - MINI Cooper, Clubman and Crossman;

 North America EBIT in North America increased $175 million to $84 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to a loss of $91 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the North American unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, EBIT increased $121 million. ""Significant Items"" including, downsizing and other restructuring activities also negatively impacted EBIT in North America by approximately $25 million and $15 million in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives (including reduced discretionary spending,
 employee reductions, reduced bonuses, and benefit plan changes)
 undertaken during or subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2008;
 - roductivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - lower affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - no employee profit sharing for the fourth quarter of 2009;
 - lower commodity costs; and
 - incremental margin earned from acquisitions completed subsequent to
 the fourth quarter of 2008.
 These factors were partially offset by: - higher warranty costs;
 - electric vehicle development costs;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the fourth quarter of
 2008.
 Europe EBIT in Europe decreased $127 million to a loss of $202 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to a loss of $75 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the European unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, EBIT decreased by $33 million. ""Significant Items"" including, downsizing and other restructuring activities; accounts receivable valuation allowances; write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related to the cancelation of an assembly program; and costs related to the delay in the start of production in a program also negatively impacted EBIT in Europe by approximately $70 million and $5 million in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - lower commodity costs;
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence
 during the second quarter of 2009;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - lower incentive compensation; and
 - the benefit of cost saving initiatives, including reduced
 discretionary spending, employee reductions, short work week
 schedules, reduced bonuses, and voluntary wage reductions.
 These factors were partially offset by: - costs incurred at new facilities in Russia as we continue to pursue
 opportunities in this market;
 - costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics capabilities;
 - costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches or for programs
 that have not fully ramped up production;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities;
 - higher warranty costs; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the fourth quarter of
 2008.
 Rest of World Rest of World EBIT increased $15 million to $18 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $3 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of incremental margin earned on new programs that launched during or subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2008 in China partially offset by costs incurred at new facilities, primarily in Japan. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other EBIT decreased $10 million to a loss of $26 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to a loss of $16 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. ""Significant Items"" including, due diligence costs associated with our planned investment in Opel, which terminated during the fourth quarter of 2009; and other losses on disposal also negatively impacted EBIT in Corporate and Other by approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to electric
 vehicle development;
 - an increase in equity income earned; and
 - the benefit of cost saving initiatives, including reduced
 discretionary spending, employee reductions, voluntary wage
 reductions and benefit plan changes.
 These factors were partially offset by a decrease in affiliation fees earned from our divisions. FUTURE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Conversion to International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") in Fiscal 2011 In February 2008, the Canadian Accounting Standards Board confirmed the transition from Canadian GAAP to IFRS for all publicly accountable entities no later than fiscal years commencing on or after January 1, 2011. As a result, throughout 2009, we undertook a detailed review of the implications of having to report under IFRS and also examined the alternative available to us, as a Foreign Private Issuer in the United States, of filing our primary financial statements in Canada using U.S. GAAP, as permitted by the Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 51-102, ""Continuous Disclosure Obligations"". In carrying out this evaluation, we considered many factors, including, but not limited to (i) the changes in accounting policies that would be required and the resulting impact on our reported results and key performance indicators, (ii) the reporting standards expected to be used by many of our industry comparables, and (iii) the financial reporting needs of our market participants, including shareholders, lenders, rating agencies and market analysts. As a result of this analysis, we have determined that we will adopt U.S. GAAP as our primary basis of financial reporting with our first reporting period beginning after January 1, 2011. We have already commenced planning and implementation of this transition and the adoption of U.S. GAAP is not anticipated to have a material change on our accounting policies or financial results, except for the reporting differences disclosed in note 26 of our 2008 consolidated financial statements. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- From time to time, we may be contingently liable for litigation and other claims. Refer to note 24 of our 2008 audited consolidated financial statements, which describes these claims. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- The previous discussion contains statements that constitute ""forward- looking statements"" within the meaning of applicable securities legislation, including, but not limited to, statements relating to growth in global and North American vehicle production; growth prospects in the Western European market; the potential for future growth in, and impact on our earnings of, our current and future investments in electronics and hybrid/electric vehicles; future growth prospects of our business; and the timing of launch of new complete vehicle assembly programs. The forward-looking information in this MD&A is presented for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward-looking statements may include financial and other projections, as well as statements regarding our future plans, objectives or economic performance, or the assumptions underlying any of the foregoing, and other statements that are not recitations of historical fact. We use words such as ""may"", ""would"", ""could"", ""should"", ""will"", ""likely"", ""expect"", ""anticipate"", ""believe"", ""intend"", ""plan"", ""forecast"", ""outlook"", ""project"", ""estimate"" and similar expressions suggesting future outcomes or events to identify forward-looking statements. Any such forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and are based on assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and our perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors we believe are appropriate in the circumstances. However, whether actual results and developments will conform with our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks, assumptions and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and the effects of which can be difficult to predict, including, without limitation: the potential for a slower than anticipated economic recovery or a deterioration of economic conditions; low production volumes and sales levels; the financial condition and credit worthiness of some of our OEM customers, including the potential that such customers may not make, or may seek to delay or reduce, payments owed to us; the financial condition of some of our suppliers and the risk of their insolvency, bankruptcy or financial restructuring; the highly competitive nature of the automotive parts supply business; our dependence on outsourcing by our customers; the termination or non renewal by our customers of any material contracts; our ability to identify and successfully exploit shifts in technology; restructuring, downsizing and/or other significant non- recurring costs; impairment charges; our ability to successfully grow our sales to non-traditional customers; unfavourable product or customer mix; risks of conducting business in foreign countries, including China, India, Brazil, Russia and other developing markets; our ability to quickly shift our manufacturing footprint to take advantage of lower cost manufacturing opportunities; disruptions in the capital and credit markets; fluctuations in relative currency values; our ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions; pricing pressures, including our ability to offset price concessions demanded by our customers; warranty and recall costs; product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage; changes in our mix of earnings between jurisdictions with lower tax rates and those with higher tax rates, as well as our ability to fully benefit tax losses; other potential tax exposures; legal claims against us; work stoppages and labour relations disputes; changes in laws and governmental regulations; costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations; potential conflicts of interest involving our indirect controlling shareholder, the Stronach Trust; and other factors set out in our Annual Information Form filed with securities commissions in Canada and our annual report on Form 40-F filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and subsequent filings. In evaluating forward-looking statements, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements and readers should specifically consider the various factors which could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. Unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, we do not intend, nor do we undertake any obligation, to update or revise any forward- looking statements to reflect subsequent information, events, results or circumstances or otherwise.

 See accompanying notes MAGNA INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Unaudited)(All amounts in U.S. dollars and all tabular amounts in millions unlessotherwise noted) ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Magna International Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively ""Magna"" or the ""Company"") have been prepared in United States dollars following Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") with respect to the preparation of interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required in the preparation of annual financial statements and therefore should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2008 audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's 2008 Annual Report. These interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the same accounting policies as the December 31, 2008 annual consolidated financial statements, except the Company retrospectively adopted the new Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants Handbook Section 3064, ""Goodwill and Intangible Assets"", with no restatement of prior periods. The adoption of these recommendations had no material impact on the interim consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which consist only of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position at December 31, 2009 and the results of operations and cash flows for the three-months and years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. 2. RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES For the years ended December 31 of 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded impairment charges as follows: 2009 2008

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------- (a) North America For the year ended December 31, 2009 In conjunction with its annual business planning cycle, during the fourth quarter of 2009 the Company determined that its Car Top Systems (""CTS"") North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired, primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic reduction in the market for soft tops, hard tops and modular retractable hard tops; and (ii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout the Company's business planning period. Based on the reporting unit's discounted forecast cashflows, the Company recorded a $25 million goodwill impairment charge. In addition, during the second quarter of 2009, after failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain facility in Syracuse, New York, the Company decided to wind down these operations. Given the significance of the facility's cashflows in relation to the reporting unit, management determined that it was more likely than not that goodwill at the Powertrain North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired. Therefore, the Company recorded a $75 million goodwill impairment charge. The goodwill impairment charges were calculated by determining the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if it had acquired the Powertrain and CTS reporting units as at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $13 million ($11 million after tax) related to fixed assets at a die casting facility in Canada and an anticipated under recovery of capitalized tooling costs at a stamping facility in the United States due to significantly lower volumes on certain SUV programs. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company recorded restructuring costs of $6 million in cost of goods sold ($6 million after tax) related to the planned closure of a powertrain facility in Syracuse, New York, substantially all of which will be paid subsequent to 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2008 During 2008, the Company recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $275 million ($238 million after tax), related primarily to its powertrain and interior and exterior systems operations in the United States and Canada. At the Company's powertrain operations, particularly at a facility in Syracuse, New York, asset impairment charges of $189 million ($169 million after tax) were recorded primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic market shift away from truck programs, in particular four wheel drive pick-up trucks and SUVs; (iii) excess die-casting, machining and assembly capacity; and (iii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout the Company's business planning period. At its interiors and exteriors operations, the Company recorded $74 million ($61 million after tax) of asset impairment charges primarily as a result of: (i) significantly lower volumes on certain pick-up truck and SUV programs; (ii) the loss of certain replacement business; and (iii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout the Company's business planning period. During 2008, the Company recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $79 million in cost of goods sold and $5 million in selling, general and administrative expense ($60 million after tax) related to the above long-lived asset impairments and other restructuring activities. Substantially all of the $84 million was paid during 2009. (b) Europe For the year ended December 31, 2009 During 2009, the Company recorded long-lived assets impairment charges of $70 million ($70 million after tax) related to its CTS and exterior systems operations in Germany. At the Company's CTS operations, long-lived asset impairment charges of $59 million ($59 million after tax) were recorded related to fixed and intangible assets. The impairment charge was calculated based on the CTS' discounted forecast cashflows and was necessary primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic reduction in the market for soft tops, hard tops and modular retractable hard tops; and (ii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout the Company's business planning period. At its exteriors operations, the Company recorded an $11 million ($11 million after tax) asset impairment charge related to specific under-utilized assets in Germany. During 2009, the Company recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $17 million in cost of goods sold and $3 million in selling, general and administrative expense ($20 million after tax). The charges consist primarily of severance and other termination benefits related to the closure of powertrain and interior systems facilities in Germany. Substantially all of the $20 million will be paid subsequent to 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2008 During 2008, the Company recorded an $8 million ($8 million after tax) asset impairment related to the disposal of specific assets at an interior systems facility in the United Kingdom and specific assets at a powertrain facility in Austria. 3.

The acquired business is primarily located in the Czech Republic with sales to various customers, including Skoda. On June 1, 2009, Magna acquired several facilities from Meridian Automotive Systems Inc. The facilities located in the United States and Mexico manufacture composites for various customers. The total consideration for these acquisitions and certain other acquisitions was $136 million, consisting of $50 million paid in cash and $86 million of assumed debt. The purchase price allocations for these acquisitions are preliminary and adjustments to the allocations may occur as a result of obtaining more information regarding asset valuations. On a preliminary basis, an allocation of the excess purchase price over the book value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been made to goodwill and intangible assets. 5. INVESTMENTS At December 31, 2009, the Company held Canadian third party asset- backed commercial paper (""ABCP"") with a face value of Cdn$134 million and a carrying value of Cdn$88 million (December 31, 2008 - Cdn$79 million), which was based on a valuation technique that estimates the fair value based on relevant current market indices for instruments of comparable credit quality, term and structure (""current market indices""). During the third quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a $9 million increase in the carrying value of it's investment in ABCP in selling, general and administrative expense, due to a tightening of the spread between the anticipated return on the restructured notes and the current market indices. During 2008, the Company recorded a $41 million impairment charge (Q3 - $24 million; Q1 - $17 million) in selling, general and administrative expense. The impairment charge was calculated based on the anticipated return on the restructured notes (the ""Notes"") versus the spreads using current market indices and a charge against potentially non-performing assets calculated on a probability weighted basis. Refer to note 8 of the Company's 2008 audited consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the significant estimates and assumptions incorporated into the valuation of our ABCP. 6.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the second quarter of 2009 the Company amended its Retiree Premium Reimbursement Plan in Canada and the United States, such that employees retiring on or after August 1, 2009 will no longer participate in the plan. The amendment will reduce service costs and retirement medical benefit expense in 2009. As a result of amending the plan, a curtailment gain of $26 million was recorded in cost of goods sold during the three-month period ended June 30, 2009. 9. INCOME TAXES During the third quarter of 2008, the Company recorded a $123 million charge to establish valuation allowances against all future tax assets in the United States. The valuation allowances were required in the United States based on historical consolidated losses at the Company's U.S. operations, that were expected to continue in the near-term, the accelerated deterioration of near-term automotive market conditions in the United States and the significant and inherent uncertainty as to the timing of when the Company would be able to generate the necessary level of earnings to recover these future tax assets. 10.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- (i) The exercise price noted above represents the weighted average exercise price in Canadian dollars. (ii) On August 12, 2009, following approval by the Company's Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee and in accordance with the Amended and Restated Incentive Stock Option Plan, the Company granted stock appreciation rights (""SARs"") to certain executives in respect of 191,700 previously granted and unexercised stock options. On August 14, 2009, 166,411 SARs were exercised and an equal number of previously granted and unexercised stock options were surrendered and cancelled. On exercise of the SARs, the executives received, in aggregate, cash of $1 million, representing an amount equal to the difference between the aggregate fair market value of the shares covered by the surrendered options and the aggregate exercise price of such surrendered options. Fair market value was determined based on the weighted average closing price of the Company's Class A Subordinate Voting Shares on the New York Stock Exchange for the five consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date of exercise. In addition, during the third quarter of 2009, 25,289 SARs were cancelled upon exercise of the corresponding number of options. The weighted average assumptions used in measuring the fair value of stock options granted or modified and the compensation expense recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses are as follows: Year ended

CAPITAL DISCLOSURES The Company manages capital in order to ensure the Company has adequate borrowing capacity and financial structure to allow financial flexibility and to provide an adequate return to shareholders. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares, purchase shares for cancellation, or increase or decrease the amount of debt outstanding. The Company monitors capital using the ratio of debt to total capitalization. Debt includes bank indebtedness and term debt as shown in the balance sheets. Total capitalization includes debt and all components of shareholders' equity. The Company's capitalization and debt to total capitalization is as follows: December December
 31, 2009 31, 2008
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 Liabilities
 Bank indebtedness $ 48 $ 909
 Long-term debt due within one year 16 157

 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 $ 4,414 $ 5,236
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 ----------------------------------------------------------------- (b) Fair value The Company determined the estimated fair values of its financial instruments based on valuation methodologies it believes are appropriate; however, considerable judgment is required to develop these estimates. Accordingly, these estimated fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The estimated fair value amounts can be materially affected by the use of different assumptions or methodologies. The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments are described below: Cash and cash equivalents, bank indebtedness, accounts payable, accrued salaries and wages, other accrued liabilities and income taxes receivable. Due to the short period to maturity of the instruments, the carrying values as presented in the consolidated balance sheets are reasonable estimates of fair values. Investments At December 31, 2009, the Company held Canadian third party asset-backed commercial paper (""ABCP"") with a face value of Cdn$134 million. The carrying value and estimated fair value of this investment was Cdn$88 million (December 31, 2008 - Cdn$79 million). As fair value information is not readily determinable for the Company's investment in ABCP, the fair value was based on a valuation technique estimating the fair value from the perspective of a market participant. In addition, fair value information is not readily available for the Company's investment in equity accounted investees. However, management believes the market value to be in excess of the carrying value of these investments. Term debt The Company's term debt includes $16 million due within one year. Due to the short period to maturity of this debt, the carrying value as presented in the consolidated balance sheet is a reasonable estimate of its fair value. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt, based on the current rates for debt with similar terms and maturities, is not materially different from its carrying value. (c) Credit risk The Company's financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, held to maturity investments, and foreign exchange forward contracts with positive fair values. The Company's held for trading investments include an investment in ABCP. Given the continuing uncertainties regarding the value of the underlying assets, the amount and timing over cash flows and the risk of collateral calls in the event that spreads widened considerably, the Company could be exposed to further losses on its investment. Cash and cash equivalents, which consists of short-term investments, are only invested in governments, bank term deposits and bank commercial paper with an investment grade credit rating. Credit risk is further reduced by limiting the amount which is invested in certain governments or any major financial institution. The Company is also exposed to credit risk from the potential default by any of its counterparties on its foreign exchange forward contracts. The Company mitigates this credit risk by dealing with counterparties who are major financial institutions that the Company anticipates will satisfy their obligations under the contracts. In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to credit risk from its customers, substantially all of which are in the automotive industry and are subject to credit risks associated with the automotive industry. Sales to the Company's three largest customers, General Motors, BMW and Ford for the three months and year ended December 31, 2009 represented 47% and 49% of the Company's total sales, respectively. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2009, sales to the Company's six largest customers (including the Detroit 3) represented 81% and 82% of the Company's total sales, respectively, and substantially all of our sales are to customers in which the Company has ongoing contractual relationships. (d) Currency risk The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates when manufacturing facilities have committed to the delivery of products for which the selling price has been quoted in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency, or when materials and equipment are purchased in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency. In an effort to manage this net foreign exchange exposure, the Company employs hedging programs, primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. As at December 31, 2009, the net foreign exchange exposure was not material. (e) Interest rate risk The Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk due to the short-term maturity of its monetary current assets and current liabilities. In particular, the amount of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents is impacted more by the investment decisions made and the demands to have available cash on hand, than by movements in the interest rates over a given period. In addition, the Company is not exposed to interest rate risk on its term debt instruments as the interest rates on these instruments are fixed.",
