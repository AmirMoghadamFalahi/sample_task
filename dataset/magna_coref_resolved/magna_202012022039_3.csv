Bob Brownlee, President, Magna Exteriors and Interiors North America said: “Crews have been on-site and working around the clock to get this plant back up and running, and we now have as much of our manufacturing capacity as possible back on-line in Howell. Between the Howell plant and the off-site location, 100% of Howell’s customer requirements are being fulfilled. With any situation like this, there are still some challenges to overcome, but we believe we are in a good position to quickly respond and manage any further issues that might arise.”
Over the past weekend, a wall was constructed to divide the Howell facility into a production zone and a reconstruction zone. On Sunday, March 6, production at Howell began on a limited basis, then resumed fully on Tuesday, March 8, just six days after the fire occurred. With on-site coordination and expertise, equipment as well as some tooling was repaired, rewired, cleaned and restarted in order to restore the supply of parts to Magna’s customers.
“Given that 40 percent of the facility sustained some level of damage and 25 percent of the production area was destroyed in the fire, executing a recovery plan in just six days was accomplished through the relentless effort, expertise, determination and coordination of many companies and people,” said Tom Skudutis, Global President, Magna Exteriors and Interiors.
“Magna has many internal resources that have been deployed to help in this situation,” said Don Walker, CEO, Magna International. “In addition, the extraordinary help and support we have received from many of the external resources and services has been tremendous. Those resources and support, combined with the help and cooperation of our customers, has been nothing short of phenomenal.”

Local fire departments, police and EMS; the American Red Cross and the Livingston County Transportation Complex; Michigan Works; the Magna Howell employees who continue to do whatever it takes to meet customer requirements; the Magna group office employees and Magna employees from numerous other divisions who have come to support the effort; the numerous contractors who continue to work relentlessly to reconstruct the facility; local governments and their representatives; and Magna’s suppliers and customers, whose partnership and cooperation has been invaluable.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, vehicle production increased 39% to 12.0 million units in North America and 12% to 13.3 million units in Europe, each compared to 2009. Also during 2010, our North American and European average dollar content per vehicle increased 13% and 8% respectively, each compared to 2009. Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 23% to $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, while complete vehicle assembly volumes increased 52% to approximately 86,000 units. During the year ended December 31, 2010, operating income was $1.2 billion, net income was $973 million and diluted earnings per share were $4.18, increases of $1.7 billion, $1.5 billion and $6.39, respectively, each compared to 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we generated cash from operations before changes in non-cash operating assets and liabilities of $1.7 billion, and generated $177 million from non-cash operating assets and liabilities. Total investment activities for 2010 were $1.0 billion, including $784 million in fixed asset additions, $141 million in investments and other assets and $106 million to purchase subsidiaries. Don Walker, Magna's Chief Executive Officer commented: ""In 2010, Magna benefitted from a strong recovery in vehicle production, both in our primary markets of North America and Western Europe as well as globally. We are positioned to capitalize on continued growth in global vehicle production in 2011 and beyond, as we further expand our manufacturing footprint in a number of growing regions of the world."" A more detailed discussion of our consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2010 is contained in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Position and the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which are attached to this Press Release. INCREASED QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND --------------------------------- Our Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend with respect to our outstanding Common Shares for the quarter ended December 31, 2010. In light of Magna's performance, the Board decided to increase the dividend by 39% to U.S. $0.25 per share. This dividend is payable on March 23, 2011 to shareholders of record on March 11, 2011. ""Our strong earnings and cash flow generation over the past year has enabled our Board to increase our dividend for the third time since we re-established our quarterly dividend last May"", stated Vince Galifi, Magna's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 2011 OUTLOOK ------------ For the full year 2011, we expect consolidated total sales to be between $25.6 billion and $27.1 billion, and expect consolidated production sales to be between $21.7 billion and $22.7 billion, based on full year 2011 light vehicle production volumes of approximately 12.9 million units in North America and approximately 13.3 million units in Western Europe. We expect full year 2011 production sales to be between $12.7 billion and $13.2 billion in North America, between $7.8 billion and $8.1 billion in Europe and between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion in Rest of World. We expect full year 2011 complete vehicle assembly sales to be between $2.4 billion and $2.7 billion. We expect our 2011 effective income tax rate to be approximately 20%. In addition, we expect that our full year 2011 spending for fixed assets will be between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion. This amount reflects continuing investment to support new and replacement business in our traditional markets as well as investment to expand in a number of high-growth markets. Finally, we expect our full year 2011 consolidated operating margin percentage, excluding unusual items, to be approximately 5%. In this 2011 outlook, in addition to 2011 light vehicle production, we have assumed no material acquisitions or divestitures. In addition, we have assumed that foreign exchange rates for the most common currencies in which we conduct business relative to our U.S. dollar reporting currency will approximate current rates.

We design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced automotive systems, assemblies, modules and components, and engineer and assemble complete vehicles, primarily for sale to original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"") of cars and light trucks. Our capabilities include the design, engineering, testing and manufacture of automotive interior systems; seating systems; closure systems; body and chassis systems; vision systems; electronic systems; exterior systems; powertrain systems; roof systems; hybrid and electric vehicles/systems; as well as complete vehicle engineering and assembly. We follow a corporate policy of functional and operational decentralization, pursuant to which we conduct our operations through divisions, each of which is an autonomous business unit operating within pre-determined guidelines. As at December 31, 2010, we had 256 manufacturing operations and 82 product development, engineering and sales centres in 26 countries. HIGHLIGHTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operations 2010 was a year of significant change for both the automotive industry and Magna. North American light vehicle production increased 39% in 2010, compared to the historically low level of production experienced in 2009. The key reason for this increase in North American light vehicle production was the improvement in North American auto sales. In Western Europe, light vehicle production increased 12% in 2010, compared to 2009. The increased production in 2010 reflected relatively strong vehicle sales in certain European countries, as well as increased exports of European-built vehicles into other markets during 2010, particularly China. Our 2010 total sales increased 39% over 2009, with North American, European and Rest of World production sales, as well as complete vehicle assembly sales, and tooling and other sales all posting increases over 2009. Rest of World production sales exceeded the $1 billion mark for the first time, increasing 53% in 2010 to $1.031 billion, compared to $676 million in 2009. Operating income for 2010 increased $1.7 billion to $1.2 billion, compared to an operating loss of $511 million for 2009. Diluted earnings per share for 2010 increased $6.39 to $4.18, compared to a diluted loss per share of $2.21 for 2009. Cash flow from operations for 2010 increased $1.3 billion to $1.87 billion, compared to $527 million for 2009. Our 2010 financial results reflect, among other things: - the improved level of light vehicle production in North America and
 Western Europe;
 - the benefits of our efforts over the last few years to restructure,
 right-size and otherwise reduce costs across the organization; and
 - the benefit of our efforts to improve underperforming operations
 around the world.
 Plan of Arrangement On August 31, 2010, following approval by our Class A Subordinate Voting and Class B Shareholders, we completed a court-approved plan of arrangement (the ""Arrangement"") in which our dual-class share structure was collapsed. In addition, the transaction: (i) set a termination date and declining fee schedule for the consulting, business development and business services contracts Magna has in place with our Chairman, Frank Stronach, and his affiliated entities; and (ii) established a partnership with the Stronach group to pursue opportunities in the vehicle electrification business. (a) Capital Transaction
 We purchased for cancellation all 1,453,658 outstanding Class B
 Shares (restated to reflect the stock split discussed below), which
 were held indirectly by the Stronach group, for $300 million in cash
 and 18.0 million newly issued Class A Subordinate Voting Shares
 (restated to reflect the stock split discussed below). The newly
 issued shares held indirectly by the Stronach group represented an
 equal equity ownership and voting interest of 7.4% as of August 31,
 2010.
 In addition, Magna's Articles were amended to remove the Class B
 Shares from the authorized capital and to make non-substantive
 consequential changes, including renaming the Class A Subordinate
 Voting Shares as Common Shares and eliminating provisions which no
 longer apply due to the elimination of the Class B Shares.
 (b) Vehicle Electrification Partnership
 The partnership, Magna E-Car Systems (""E-Car""), involves the
 engineering, development and integration of electric vehicles of any
 type, the development, testing and manufacturing of batteries and
 battery packs for hybrid and electric vehicles and all
 ancillary activities in connection with electric vehicle
 technologies. Our original investment in the partnership included the
 assets of our recently established E-Car Systems vehicle
 electrification and battery business unit, certain other vehicle
 electrification assets, and $145 million in cash. On August 31, 2010,
 the Stronach group invested $80 million in cash for a 27% equity
 interest in the partnership, reducing our equity interest to 73%. The
 partnership is controlled by the Stronach group.
 Stock Split On November 24, 2010, we completed a two-for-one stock split, which was implemented by way of a stock dividend. In connection with the stock split, all equity-based compensation plans or arrangements were adjusted to reflect the issuance of additional Common Shares. Accordingly, all of our issued and outstanding Common Shares and our former Class A Subordinate Voting and Class B shares, including the shares issued in connection with the Arrangement, as well as incentive stock options, and stock appreciation rights (""SARs"") have been restated for all periods presented to reflect the stock split. In addition, earnings (loss) per Common Share or Class B Share, cash dividends paid per Common Share or Class B Share, weighted average exercise price for stock options and the weighted average fair value of options granted or modified have been restated for all periods presented to reflect the stock split. Dividends Due to continuing strong operating and cash flow performance, on February 23, 2011 our Board declared a dividend of U.S. $0.25 per share in respect of the fourth quarter of 2010, representing an increase of 39% over the third quarter of 2010 dividend and the third consecutive dividend increase since the reintroduction of the dividend in the first quarter of 2010. Normal Course Issuer Bid On November 4, 2010, our Board of Directors approved a normal course issuer bid to purchase up to 8.0 million of our issued and outstanding Common Shares (adjusted to reflect the stock split), representing approximately 3.3% of our outstanding Common Shares. The primary purposes of the normal course issuer bid are purchases for cancellation to offset potential dilution resulting from the exercise of stock options and/or to fund our restricted stock unit program and our obligations to our deferred profit sharing plans. The normal course issuer bid will terminate in November 2011. Governance Since the elimination of our dual-class share structure effective August 31, 2010, we have implemented a number of significant corporate governance initiatives, including the: - adoption of a majority voting policy;
 - reconstitution of the Nominating Committee of our Board of Directors
 as a fully independent Committee; and
 - initiation of a search for additional independent directors with the
 assistance of an internationally recognized firm.
 Acquisitions Consistent with our strategy to expand in new regions, in December 2010, we acquired seating companies in Brazil and Argentina. Combined 2010 sales in the two seating companies amounted to $260 million. Also during December 2010, we acquired Erhard & Sohne GmbH, a manufacturer of fuel tanks. Going Forward Following a strong rebound in 2010, we expect global light vehicle production to grow further in 2011, provided that overall economic conditions continue to improve. In North America, light vehicle production should experience strong growth in 2011, although production remains well off peak levels. In Western Europe, we expect light vehicle production to be approximately level with 2010. Our strategy includes: - continued expansion in high growth and developing markets;
 - increased investment in innovation to remain at the forefront of the
 automotive industry;
 - further diversification of sales by customer, by region and by
 vehicle segment; and
 - continued support of our existing customers globally.
 We expect this strategy to be implemented both through organic growth as well as targeted acquisitions. FINANCIAL RESULTS SUMMARY ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During 2010, we posted sales of $24.1 billion, an increase of 39% from 2009. This higher sales level was a result of increases in our North American, European and Rest of World production sales, complete vehicle assembly sales and tooling, engineering and other sales. Comparing 2010 to 2009: - North American vehicle production increased by 39% and average dollar
 content per vehicle increased 13%;
 - European vehicle production increased 12% and average dollar content
 per vehicle increased 8%;
 - Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 23% to $2.2 billion, as
 complete vehicle assembly volumes increased 52%;
 - Rest of World production sales increased 53% to $1.0 billion from
 $0.7 billion; and
 - Tooling, engineering and other sales increased 26% to $2.0 billion
 from $1.6 billion.
 During 2010, we earned operating income of $1.2 billion compared to an operating loss of $0.5 billion for 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2010 and 2009, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $1.6 billion increase in operating income was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, operating income was positively impacted by: - lower restructuring and downsizing costs and the benefit of prior
 year restructuring and downsizing activities;
 - a $32 million recovery, during 2010, of receivables that were fully
 provided for in 2009;
 - favourable settlement of certain commercial items;
 - the write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related
 to the cancellation of assembly programs in 2009;
 - higher equity income;
 - due diligence costs incurred in 2009 associated with our planned
 investment in Opel, which terminated during 2009;
 - the $20 million benefit related to the recovery of previously
 expensed engineering and design costs;
 - higher interest income;
 - incremental margin earned on acquisitions completed during or
 subsequent to 2009, including Cadence Innovation s.r.o. (""Cadence"");
 - lower costs incurred related to launches at our Complete Vehicle
 Assembly operations; and
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities.
 These factors were partially offset by: - higher incentive compensation;
 - higher costs related to launches at our components business;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities, in
 particular at certain exteriors and interiors systems facilities in
 Europe;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - a $20 million stock-based compensation charge as a result of
 modifying option agreements with three departing executives and a
 related $9 million contract termination payment;
 - increased stock-based compensation;
 - a $9 million favourable revaluation of our investment in asset-backed
 commercial paper (""ABCP"") in 2009; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2009.
 During 2010, net income increased $1.5 billion to $1.0 billion compared to net loss of $0.5 billion for 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2010 and 2009, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income for 2010 increased $1.3 billion. The increase in net income was a result of the increase in operating income and minority interest recovery, partially offset by higher income taxes. During 2010, our diluted earnings per share increased by $6.39 to $4.18 compared to loss per share of $2.21 for 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2010 and 2009, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, diluted earnings per share for 2010 increased by $5.66. The increase in diluted earnings per share is as a result of the increase in net income partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during 2010. The increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to the net issue of shares during 2010 related primarily to the Arrangement and an increase in the number of diluted shares associated with stock options and restricted stock partially offset by the effect of the repurchase and cancellation of Common Shares pursuant to our normal course issuer bid. UNUSUAL ITEMS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the three months and year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we recorded certain unusual items as follows: 2010 2009

 (a) For the year ended December 31, 2010
 (i) Long-lived Assets
 In conjunction with our annual business planning cycle,
 during the fourth quarter of 2010, we completed our annual
 goodwill impairment and long-lived asset analysis and
 recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $23 million.
 In North America, we recorded charges of $7 million related
 to fixed assets at a die casting facility in Canada and in
 Germany, we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of
 $16 million related to an interiors systems facility.
 (ii) Restructuring Costs
 During 2010, we recorded restructuring and rationalization
 costs of $29 million in cost of goods sold and $3 million in
 selling, general and administrative expense related to the
 planned closure of a powertrain systems facility and two
 body & chassis systems facilities in North America.
 (b) For the year ended December 31, 2009
 (i) Goodwill
 In conjunction with our annual business planning cycle,
 during the fourth quarter of 2009 we determined that our Car
 Top Systems (""CTS"") North America reporting unit could
 potentially be impaired, primarily as a result of: (i) a
 dramatic reduction in the market for soft tops, hard tops
 and modular retractable hard tops; and (ii) historical
 losses that are projected to continue throughout our
 business planning period. Based on the reporting unit's
 discounted forecast cashflows, we recorded a $25 million
 goodwill impairment charge.
 In addition, during the second quarter of 2009, after
 failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a
 powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York, we
 decided to wind down these operations. Given the
 significance of the facility's cashflows in relation to the
 reporting unit, management determined that it was more
 likely than not that goodwill at the Powertrain North
 America reporting unit could potentially be impaired.
 Therefore, we recorded a $75 million goodwill impairment
 charge.
 The goodwill impairment charges were calculated by
 determining the implied fair value of goodwill in the same
 manner as if we had acquired the Powertrain and CTS
 reporting units as at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009,
 respectively.
 (ii) Long-lived Assets
 During the fourth quarter of 2009 we recorded long-lived
 asset impairment charges of $83 million.
 In North America, we recorded charges of $13 million related
 to fixed assets at a die casting facility in Canada and an
 anticipated under recovery of capitalized tooling costs at a
 stamping facility in the United States due to significantly
 lower volumes on certain SUV programs.
 In Europe, we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges
 of $70 million related to our CTS and exterior systems
 operations in Germany.
 At our CTS operations, long-lived asset impairment charges
 of $59 million were recorded related to fixed and intangible
 assets. The impairment charge was calculated based on CTS'
 discounted forecast cashflows and was necessary primarily as
 a result of: (i) a dramatic reduction in the market for soft
 tops, hard tops and modular retractable hard tops; and (ii)
 historical losses that are projected to continue throughout
 our business planning period.
 At our interiors and exteriors operations, we recorded an
 $11 million asset impairment charge related to specific
 under-utilized assets in Germany.
 (iii) Restructuring Costs
 During 2009, we recorded restructuring and rationalization
 costs of $23 million in cost of goods sold and $3 million in
 selling, general and administrative expense. During the
 second quarter, we recorded restructuring costs of $6
 million related to the planned closure of a powertrain
 systems facility in Syracuse, New York and during the fourth
 quarter we recorded severance and other termination benefits
 related to the closure of powertrain and interior systems
 facilities in Germany. Substantially all of the $26 million
 will be paid subsequent to 2009.
 In addition, during 2009, we incurred costs related to
 downsizing various operations in our traditional markets.
 (2) Sale of Facilities
 During 2010, we sold our interest in an electronics systems joint
 venture in China and realized a $14 million gain.
 During 2009, we entered into an agreement to sell an engineering
 centre in Europe and, as a result, incurred a loss on disposition of
 the facility of $8 million.
 (3) Curtailment gain
 During the second quarter of 2009, we amended our Retiree Premium
 Reimbursement Plan in Canada and the United States, such that most
 employees retiring on or after August 1, 2009 would no longer
 participate in the plan. The amendment reduced service costs and
 retirement medical benefit expense in 2009 and future years. As a
 result of amending the plan, a curtailment gain of $26 million was
 recorded in cost of goods sold in the second quarter of 2009. INDUSTRY TRENDS AND RISKS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- A number of general trends which have been impacting the automotive industry and our business in recent years are expected to continue, including the following: - the exertion of pricing pressure by OEMs;
 - government incentives and consumer demand for, and industry focus on,
 more fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly vehicles with
 alternative-energy fuel systems and additional safety features;
 - governmental regulation of fuel economy and emissions, vehicle
 recyclability and vehicle safety;
 - the long-term growth of the automotive industry in China, India,
 Brazil, Russia and other developing markets, including accelerated
 migration of component and vehicle design, development, engineering
 and manufacturing to certain of these markets;
 - the growth of the A to D vehicle segments (micro to mid-size cars),
 particularly in developing markets;
 - the consolidation of vehicle platforms; and
 - the growth of cooperative alliances and arrangements among competing
 automotive OEMs, including shared purchasing of components; joint
 engine, powertrain and/or platform development; engine, powertrain
 and platform sharing; and joint vehicle hybridization and
 electrification initiatives.
 The following are some of the more significant risks that could affect our ability to achieve our desired results: - The global automotive industry is cyclical and is sensitive to
 changes in economic and political conditions, including interest
 rates, energy prices and international conflicts. While the global
 automotive industry appears to be recovering from the severe economic
 downturn which began in the second half of 2008, the strength and
 speed of the recovery, as well as its consistency across geographic
 markets remains uncertain. This uncertainty creates planning risks
 for us. Additionally, as a result of restructuring actions taken by
 OEMs and suppliers during the recent downturn, automotive production
 levels are more closely aligned with actual automotive sales levels
 and, accordingly, may be more sensitive to overall economic
 conditions than in the years prior to 2008. A significant decline in
 production volumes from current levels could have a material adverse
 effect on our profitability. As a result of the restructuring actions
 taken by suppliers during the recent economic downturn, there is a
 risk that some suppliers may not have adequate capacity to timely
 accommodate increases in demand for their parts which result from a
 significant, rapid increase in production volumes. Such a failure by
 a supplier could lead to occasional components shortages or
 production disruptions, which could have an adverse effect on our
 operations and profitability.
 - The short-term viability of several of our OEM customers appears to
 have improved as a result of restructuring actions in the past few
 years, as well as direct government financial intervention in the
 automotive industry in 2008 and 2009. However, there can be no
 assurance that these restructuring actions will be successful in
 ensuring their long-term viability, nor can there be any assurance
 that government financial assistance will be made available at levels
 necessary to prevent OEM failures in the future. The bankruptcy of
 any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on
 our profitability and financial condition.
 - We rely on a number of suppliers to supply us with a wide range of
 components required in connection with our business. While the
 automotive supply base appears to have stabilized following the
 economic downturn which commenced in the second half of 2008, the
 financial health of automotive suppliers was impacted by economic
 conditions, production volume cuts, intense pricing pressures and
 other factors. The insolvency or bankruptcy of a supplier could
 disrupt the supply of components to us or our customers, potentially
 causing the temporary shut-down of our or our customers' production
 lines. Any prolonged disruption in the supply of critical components
 to us or our customers, the inability to re-source or in-source
 production of a critical component from a financially distressed
 automotive components sub-supplier, or any temporary shut-down of one
 of our production lines or the production lines of one of our
 customers, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
 Additionally, the insolvency, bankruptcy or financial restructuring
 of any of our critical suppliers could result in us incurring
 unrecoverable costs related to the financial work-out of such
 suppliers and/or increased exposure for product liability, warranty
 or recall costs relating to the components supplied by such suppliers
 to the extent such supplier is not able to assume responsibility for
 such amounts, which could have an adverse effect on our
 profitability.
 - The automotive parts supply industry is highly competitive. As a
 result of our diversified automotive business, we face a number of
 competitors possessing varying degrees of financial and operational
 strength in each of our product and service capabilities. Some of our
 competitors have a substantially greater market share than we have in
 certain product areas and are dominant in some of the markets in
 which we do business. In addition, restructuring actions taken by
 some of our competitors have provided them with improved financial
 and operational flexibility and could increase their competitive
 threat to our business. Failure to successfully compete with our
 existing competitors or with any new competitors could have an
 adverse effect on our operations and profitability.
 - We are dependent on the outsourcing of components, modules and
 assemblies, as well as complete vehicles, by OEMs. The extent of OEM
 outsourcing is influenced by a number of factors, including: relative
 cost, quality and timeliness of production by suppliers as compared
 to OEMs; capacity utilization; OEMs' perceptions regarding the
 strategic importance of certain components/modules to them; labour
 relations among OEMs, their employees and unions; and other
 considerations. As a result of lower cost structures due to recent
 restructuring actions, some OEMs may in-source production which had
 previously been outsourced. Outsourcing of complete vehicle assembly
 is particularly dependent on the degree of unutilized capacity at the
 OEMs' own assembly facilities, in addition to the foregoing factors.
 A reduction in outsourcing by OEMs, or the loss of any material
 production or assembly programs coupled with the failure to secure
 alternative programs with sufficient volumes and margins, could have
 a material adverse effect on our profitability.
 - We continue to invest in technology and innovation which we believe
 will be critical to our long-term growth. Our ability to anticipate
 changes in technology and to successfully develop and introduce new
 and enhanced products and/or manufacturing processes on a timely
 basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain
 competitive. If there is a shift away from the use of technologies in
 which we are investing, our costs may not be fully recovered. We may
 be placed at a competitive disadvantage if other technologies in
 which our investment is not as great, or our expertise is not as
 developed, emerge as the industry-leading technologies. This could
 have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial
 condition.
 - As part of our strategy of continuously seeking to optimize our
 global manufacturing footprint, we may further rationalize some of
 our production facilities. In the course of such rationalization, we
 may incur further restructuring, downsizing and/or other significant
 non-recurring costs related to plant closings, relocations and
 employee severance costs. Restructuring costs may be greater in
 certain jurisdictions than others as a result of the size and scope
 of the restructuring, differences in laws, and other factors. Such
 costs could have an adverse effect on our short-term profitability.
 In addition, we are working to turn around financially
 underperforming divisions; however, there is no guarantee that we
 will be successful in doing so with respect to some or all such
 divisions.
 - We recorded significant impairment charges related to goodwill, long-
 lived assets and future tax assets in recent years and may continue
 to do so in the future. The bankruptcy of a significant customer or
 the early termination, loss, renegotiation of the terms of, or delay
 in the implementation of, any significant production contract could
 be indicators of impairment. In addition, to the extent that forward-
 looking assumptions regarding: the impact of improvement plans on
 current operations; in-sourcing and other new business opportunities;
 program price and cost assumptions on current and future business;
 the timing of new program launches; and forecast production volumes;
 are not met, any resulting impairment loss could have a material
 adverse effect on our profitability.
 - Although we supply parts to all of the leading OEMs, a significant
 majority of our sales are to six such customers. While we have
 diversified our customer base somewhat in recent years and continue
 to attempt to further diversify, particularly to increase our
 business with Asian-based OEMs, there is no assurance we will be
 successful. Our inability to successfully grow our sales to non-
 traditional customers could have a material adverse effect on our
 profitability.
 - While we supply parts for a wide variety of vehicles produced
 globally, we do not supply parts for all vehicles produced, nor is
 the number or value of parts evenly distributed among the vehicles
 for which we do supply parts. Shifts in market shares among vehicles
 or vehicle segments, particularly shifts away from vehicles on which
 we have significant content and shifts away from vehicle segments in
 which our sales may be more heavily concentrated, or the early
 termination, loss, renegotiation of the terms of, or delay in the
 implementation of, any significant production or assembly contract
 could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
 - Many of our customers have sought, and will likely continue to seek
 to take advantage of lower operating costs and/or other advantages in
 China, India, Brazil, Russia and other developing markets. While we
 continue to expand our manufacturing footprint with a view to taking
 advantage of manufacturing opportunities in these markets, we cannot
 guarantee that we will be able to fully realize such opportunities.
 Additionally, the establishment of manufacturing operations in new
 markets carries its own risks, including those relating to political
 and economic instability; trade, customs and tax risks; currency
 exchange rates; currency controls; limitations on the repatriation of
 funds; insufficient infrastructure; and other risks associated with
 conducting business internationally. The inability to quickly adjust
 our manufacturing footprint to take advantage of manufacturing
 opportunities in these markets could harm our ability to compete with
 other suppliers operating in or from such markets, which could have
 an adverse effect on our profitability.
 - Prices for certain key raw materials and commodities used in our
 parts, particularly resin and other oil-based items, have been
 escalating and may continue to do so. To the extent we are unable to
 mitigate commodities price increases through hedging strategies, by
 engineering products with reduced commodity content, by passing
 commodity price increases to our customers or otherwise, such
 additional commodity costs could have a material adverse effect on
 our profitability.
 - We currently have a global credit facility with a syndicate of
 lenders that is set to mature in July 2012. While we intend to seek a
 renewal of the credit facility prior to its maturity, the terms of
 any renewal are subject to a number of factors, including prevailing
 economic, financial and industry conditions. There is no guarantee
 that we will be successful in negotiating terms, including cost of
 borrowing and restrictive covenants, which are as favourable as those
 in our current credit facility. In addition, there can be no
 assurance that the aggregate borrowing limit under any renewed credit
 facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements and,
 as a result, we may be required to seek more other sources of
 capital, which may be more costly, which could have an adverse effect
 on our financial condition.
 - The failure of any major financial institutions in the future could
 lead to significant disruptions in capital and credit markets and
 could adversely affect our and our customers' ability to access
 needed liquidity for working capital. In addition, in the event of a
 failure of a financial institution - in which we invest our cash
 reserves; that is a counterparty in a derivatives transaction
 (primarily currency and commodities hedges) with us; or that is a
 lender to us - we face the risk that that our cash reserves and
 amounts owing to us pursuant to derivative transactions may not be
 fully recoverable, or the amount of credit available to us may be
 significantly reduced. All of these risks could have an adverseeffect
 on our financial condition.
 - Europe is currently in the midst of a ""sovereign debt"" crisis as a
 result of widespread concern about the ability of several European
 governments to repay its outstanding indebtedness. The crisis has
 necessitated comprehensive financial rescue packages in an attempt to
 avert more serious financial turmoil. Despite the financial rescue
 efforts to date, additional actions may be required in the short-term
 and considerable uncertainty remains with respect to the economic
 condition of several European countries. A deepening of the sovereign
 debt crisis in Europe or a spread of the crisis beyond Europe could
 undermine credit markets, equity and bond markets, and consumer
 confidence, which in turn could have negative consequences for the
 global economy. In such circumstances, many of the risks faced by the
 automotive industry and our business could intensify, which could
 have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition
 and profitability.
 - Although our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a
 significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in
 Canadian dollars, euros, British pounds and other currencies. Our
 profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against the
 Canadian dollar, the euro, the British pound and other currencies in
 which we generate revenues and incur expenses. However, as a result
 of hedging programs employed by us, foreign currency transactions are
 not fully impacted by movements in exchange rates. We record foreign
 currency transactions at the hedged rate where applicable. Despite
 these measures, significant long-term fluctuations in relative
 currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative
 values of the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, euro or British pound,
 could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial
 condition and any sustained change in such relative currency values
 could adversely impact our competitiveness in certain geographic
 regions.
 - We have completed a number of acquisitions and may continue to do so
 in the future. In those product areas in which we have identified
 acquisitions as a key aspect of our business strategy, we may not be
 able to identify suitable acquisition targets or successfully acquire
 any suitable targets which we identify. Additionally, we may not be
 able to successfully integrate or achieve anticipated synergies from
 those acquisitions which we do complete and such failure could have a
 material adverse effect on our profitability.
 - We face significant pricing pressure, as well as pressure to absorb
 costs related to product design, engineering and tooling, as well as
 other items previously paid for directly by OEMs. The continuation or
 intensification of these pricing pressures and pressure to absorb
 costs could have an adverse effect on our profitability.
 - Our customers continue to demand that we bear the cost of the repair
 and replacement of defective products which are either covered under
 their warranty or are the subject of a recall by them. Warranty
 provisions are established based on our best estimate of the amounts
 necessary to settle existing or probable claims on product defect
 issues. Recall costs are costs incurred when government regulators
 and/or our customers decide to recall a product due to a known or
 suspected performance issue and we are required to participate either
 voluntarily or involuntarily. Currently, under most customer
 agreements, we only account for existing or probable warranty claims.
 Under certain complete vehicle engineering and assembly contracts, we
 record an estimate of future warranty-related costs based on the
 terms of the specific customer agreements and the specific customer's
 warranty experience. While we possess considerable historical
 warranty and recall data and experience with respect to the products
 we currently produce, we have little or no warranty and recall data
 which allows us to establish accurate estimates of, or provisions
 for, future warranty or recall costs relating to new products,
 assembly programs or technologies being brought into production. The
 obligation to repair or replace such products could have a material
 adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.
 - Our vehicle electrification business is currently conducted through a
 partnership, E-Car, which is indirectly controlled by
 the Stronach group as a result of its right to appoint three of the
 five members of the management committee through which the business
 and affairs of the partnership are managed and controlled. Subject to
 our veto rights in respect of certain fundamental changes and
 specified business decisions, the Stronach group is able to cause
 E-Car to effect transactions without our consent. In
 addition, E-Car has an unrestricted right to compete
 with us, now or in the future, in the design, engineering,
 manufacture or sale of electric or hybrid-electric vehicle
 components. Despite the Stronach group's control of E-Car,
 our customers may continue to look to us for resolution of
 financial, operational, quality or warranty issues relating to
 programs for which E-Car is responsible.
 - We have no obligation to make additional investments in Magna E-Car
 Systems under the terms of the E-Car partnership agreement.
 However, there is no assurance that the initial capital
 contributions made by us and the Stronach group to E-Car
 will be sufficient to fund its ongoing operations. Subject to
 approval by the unconflicted members of our Board (which excludes Mr.
 Stronach, who would have a conflict of interest), we may or may not
 choose to make further investments in E-Car. That determination
 will be based on what will best serve Magna's long-term business.
 Our ability to recover our initial investment or any potential
 subsequent investment(s) in E-Car is subject to a number of risks
 and uncertainties, including E-Car's ability to successfully
 introduce and commercially provide its products and services. The
 failure to recover our investment in E-Car could adversely affect
 Magna's profitability.
 - We continue to pursue opportunities in areas that are complementary
 to our existing automotive design, engineering and manufacturing
 capabilities, such as structural elements and panels for solar
 panels, stamped components for consumer durables, including household
 appliances, and various components for heavy trucks, all in order to
 more efficiently use our capital assets, technological know-how and
 manufacturing capacity. Many of these ""non-automotive"" industries are
 subject to some of the same types of risks as our automotive
 business, including: sensitivity to economic conditions, cyclicality
 and technology risks. We also face a diverse number of competitors
 possessing varying degrees of financial and operational strength and
 experience in their industry. Failure to successfully compete in
 these and other non-automotive businesses could have an adverse
 effect on our operations and profitability.
 - From time to time, we may become liable for legal, contractual and
 other claims by various parties, including customers, suppliers,
 former employees, class action plaintiffs and others. On an ongoing
 basis, we attempt to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments
 or outcomes to these claims, although it is difficult to predict
 final outcomes with any degree of certainty. At this time, we do not
 believe that any of the claims to which we are party will have a
 material adverse effect on our financial position; however, we cannot
 provide any assurance to this effect. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Average Foreign Exchange For the three months For the year

 The preceding table reflects the average foreign exchange rates between the most common currencies in which we conduct business and our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The significant changes in these foreign exchange rates for the three months and year ended December 31, 2010 impacted the reported U.S. dollar amounts of our sales, expenses and income. The results of operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates in the table above for the relevant period. Throughout this MD&A, reference is made to the impact of translation of foreign operations on reported U.S. dollar amounts where relevant. Our results can also be affected by the impact of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency transactions (such as raw material purchases or sales denominated in foreign currencies). However, as a result of hedging programs employed by us, foreign currency transactions in the current period have not been fully impacted by movements in exchange rates. We record foreign currency transactions at the hedged rate where applicable. Finally, holding gains and losses on foreign currency denominated monetary items, which are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, impact reported results.

 External Production Sales - North America External production sales in North America increased 57% or $4.3 billion to $11.8 billion for 2010 compared to $7.5 billion for 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 39% increase in North American vehicle production volumes combined with a 13% increase in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. Our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 13% or $116 to $988 for 2010 compared to $872 for 2009, primarily as a result of: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to 2009, including
 the:
 - Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain;
 - Jeep Grand Cherokee;
 - Ford Fiesta;
 - Chevrolet Cruze; and
 - Cadillac SRX;
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and Volkswagen
 Routan;
 - GM full-sized pickups and SUVs;
 - Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave; and
 - Jeep Wrangler;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening of
 the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar; and
 - the acquisition of several facilities from Meridian Automotive
 Systems Inc. (""Meridian"") in the third quarter of 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by: - programs that ended production during or subsequent to 2009,
 including the Pontiac, Saturn and Mercury brands;
 - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the Ford Escape and Mazda Tribute; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2009.
 External Production Sales - Europe External production sales in Europe increased 22% or $1.28 billion to $7.14 billion for 2010 compared to $5.86 billion for 2009. This increase in production sales reflects an 8% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle combined with a 12% increase in European vehicle production volumes. Our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 8% or $41 to $536 for 2010 compared to $495 for 2009, primarily as a result of: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to 2009, including
 the:
 - MINI Countryman;
 - Mercedes-Benz SLS;
 - Peugeot RCZ;
 - Porsche Panamera; and
 - Porsche Cayenne and Volkswagen Touareg;
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs; and
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to 2009, including
 Cadence.
 These factors were partially offset by: - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the
 euro and British pound, each against the U.S. dollar;
 - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to 2009,
 including the BMW X3; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2009.
 External Production Sales - Rest of World External production sales in Rest of World increased 53% or $355 million to $1.03 billion for 2010 compared to $0.68 billion for 2009, primarily as a result of: - increased production and/or content on certain programs in China and
 Korea;
 - the acquisition of a Japanese roof systems facility in the first
 quarter of 2010;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to 2009 in China and
 Korea;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales as a result of the
 strengthening of the Brazilian real and Korean Won, both against the
 U.S. dollar; and
 - production related to the launch of new facilities in Korea and
 India.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the sale of our interest in an electronics systems joint venture in
 China in the first quarter of 2010; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2009.
 Complete Vehicle Assembly Sales The terms of our various vehicle assembly contracts differ with respect to the ownership of components and supplies related to the assembly process and the method of determining the selling price to the OEM customer. Under certain contracts we are acting as principal, and purchased components and systems in assembled vehicles are included in our inventory and cost of sales. These costs are reflected on a full-cost basis in the selling price of the final assembled vehicle to the OEM customer. Other contracts provide that third-party components and systems are held on consignment by us, and the selling price to the OEM customer reflects a value-added assembly fee only. Production levels of the various vehicles assembled by us have an impact on the level of our sales and profitability. In addition, the relative proportion of programs accounted for on a full-cost basis and programs accounted for on a value-added basis also impacts our level of sales and operating margin percentage, but may not necessarily affect our overall level of profitability. Assuming no change in total vehicles assembled, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a full-cost basis has the effect of increasing the level of total sales, however, because purchased components are included in cost of sales, profitability as a percentage of total sales is reduced. Conversely, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a value-added basis has the effect of reducing the level of total sales and increasing profitability as a percentage of total sales.

 Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 23% or $0.4 billion to $2.2 billion for 2010 compared to $1.8 billion for 2009, while assembly volumes increased 52% or 29,563 units. The increase in complete vehicle assembly sales is primarily as a result of: - the launch of new assembly programs during or subsequent to 2009,
 including the:
 - MINI Countryman;
 - Peugeot RCZ; and
 - Aston Martin Rapide; and
 - an increase in assembly volumes for the Mercedes-Benz G-Class.
 These factors were partially offset by the end of production on certain assembly programs at our Magna Steyr facility, including the: - BMW X3 in the third quarter of 2010;
 - Saab 9(3) Convertible in the fourth quarter of 2009; and
 - Chrysler 300 and Jeep Grand Cherokee in the second quarter of 2010.
 In addition, complete vehicle assembly sales were negatively impacted by a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. Tooling, Engineering and Other Tooling, engineering and other sales increased 26% or $0.4 billion to $2.0 billion for 2010 compared to $1.6 billion for 2009. In 2010, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - MINI Cooper and Countryman;
 - BMW X3;
 - Mercedes-Benz M-Class;
 - Ford Fiesta;
 - Jeep Grand Cherokee;
 - Volkswagen Touareg;
 - Chrysler 300C, Dodge Charger and Challenger;
 - Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra;
 - Porsche Cayenne; and
 - Peugeot RCZ.
 In 2009, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - MINI Cooper, Clubman and Crossman;
 - Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra;
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Opel/Vauxhall Astra;
 - Audi Q5;
 - BMW X3;
 - Porsche Boxster and Cayman;
 - Porsche Cayenne;
 - Mercedes-Benz M-Class;
 - Peugeot RCZ;
 - Cadillac SRX and Saab 9-4X;
 - Ford F-Series; and
 - Mercedes-Benz C-Class.
 In addition, tooling, engineering and other sales decreased as a result of the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. Gross Margin Gross margin increased $1.5 billion to $3.2 billion for 2010 compared to $1.7 billion for 2009 and gross margin as a percentage of total sales increased to 13.2% for 2010 compared to 9.6% for 2009. The unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section negatively impacted gross margin as a percentage of total sales in 2010 by 0.1%. Excluding unusual items, gross margin as a percentage of total sales increased 3.7% substantially due to increased gross margin earned as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, gross margin as a percentage of total sales was positively impacted by: - lower restructuring and downsizing costs and the benefit of prior
 year restructuring and downsizing activities;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to 2009;
 - favourable settlement of certain commercial items;
 - the write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related
 to the cancellation of assembly programs in 2009;
 - the $20 million benefit related to the recovery of previously
 expensed engineering and design costs; and
 - lower costs incurred related to launches at our Complete Vehicle
 Assembly operations.
 These factors were partially offset by: - higher costs incurred related to launches at our components business;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities, in
 particular at certain exteriors and interiors systems facilities in
 Europe;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - higher development and launch costs in E-Car;
 - an increase in complete vehicle assembly sales which have a lower
 gross margin than our consolidated average;
 - an increase in tooling sales that earn low or no margins; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2009.
 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization costs decreased 10% or $76 million to $661 million for 2010 compared to $737 million for 2009. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily as a result of: - the impairment of certain assets during or subsequent to 2009;
 - lower capital spending in recent years; and
 - the disposition of certain facilities subsequent to 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by an increase in reported U.S. dollar depreciation and amortization due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar; Selling, General and Administrative (""SG&A"") SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 5.6% for 2010, compared to 7.3% for 2009. The unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section negatively impacted SG&A as a percentage of total sales by 0.1% in 2009. Excluding these unusual items, SG&A as a percentage of total sales decreased 1.6%. SG&A expense increased $79 million to $1.34 billion for 2010 compared to $1.26 billion for 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2010 and 2009 (as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section), SG&A expenses increased by $101 million primarily as a result of: - higher incentive compensation;
 - a $20 million stock-based compensation charge as a result of
 modifying option agreements with three departing executives and a
 related $9 million contract termination payment;
 - higher stock-based compensation;
 - a $9 million favourable revaluation of our investment in ABCP in
 2009;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar SG&A due to the strengthening of
 the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar; and
 - higher costs to support the increased sales level.
 These factors were partially offset by: - a $32 million recovery, during 2010, of receivables that were fully
 provided for in 2009;
 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs;
 - due diligence costs incurred in 2009 associated with our planned
 investment in Opel, which terminated during 2009;
 - loss on disposal of assets in 2009;
 - net gain on disposal of assets; and
 - the closure or disposition of certain facilities during or subsequent
 to 2009.
 Impairment Charges Impairment charges decreased $160 million to $23 million for 2010 compared to $183 million for 2009 as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section. Earnings before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"")(1) For the year ended December 31,

 North America EBIT in North America increased $1.2 billion to $1.1 billion for 2010 compared to a loss of $0.1 billion for 2009. Excluding the North American unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $1.1 billion increase in EBIT was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - lower restructuring and downsizing costs and the benefit of prior
 year restructuring and downsizing activities;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - lower warranty costs;
 - the launch of new facilities;
 - a $6 million recovery, during 2010, of receivables that were fully
 provided for in 2009; and
 - a gain on sale of an investment.
 These factors were partially offset by: - higher costs incurred related to launches;
 - higher affiliation fees paid to Corporate;
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2009.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (1) EBIT is defined as income (loss) from operations before income taxes
 and minority interest as presented on our unaudited interim
 consolidated financial statements before net interest (income)
 expense.
 Europe EBIT in Europe increased $0.5 billion to $0.1 billion for 2010 compared to a loss of $0.4 billion for 2009. Excluding the European unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $0.4 billion increase in EBIT was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - lower restructuring and downsizing costs and the benefit of prior
 year restructuring and downsizing activities;
 - a $26 million recovery, during 2010, of receivables that were fully
 provided for in 2009;
 - favourable settlement of certain commercial items;
 - the write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related
 to the cancellation of assembly programs in 2009;
 - lower costs incurred related to launches at our Complete Vehicle
 Assembly operations;
 - the sale or closure of certain underperforming divisions during or
 subsequent to 2009;
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence; and
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities.
 These factors were partially offset by: - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities, in
 particular at certain exteriors and interiors systems facilities;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher costs incurred related to launches at our components
 business, including Russia;
 - higher affiliation fees paid to Corporate;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - higher warranty costs;
 - higher incentive compensation; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2009.
 Rest of World Rest of World EBIT increased $49 million to $92 million for 2010 compared to $43 million for 2009. Excluding the Rest of World unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $35 million increase was primarily as a result of: - additional margin earned on increased production sales; and
 - incremental margin earned on new programs that launched during or
 subsequent to 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by: - higher launch costs related to new facilities, primarily in Korea,
 Brazil and India;
 - the write-off of certain assets;
 - higher warranty costs;
 - higher affiliation fees paid to Corporate;
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2009; and
 - increased commodity costs.
 E-Car Systems E-Car Systems EBIT decreased $48 million to a loss of $89 million for 2010 compared to a loss of $41 million for 2009, primarily as a result of higher development and launch costs. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other EBIT increased $37 million to a loss of $3 million for 2010 compared to a loss of $40 million for 2009, primarily as a result of: - an increase in affiliation fees earned from our divisions;
 - the positive impact of foreign exchange;
 - due diligence costs incurred in 2009 associated with our planned
 investment in Opel, which terminated during 2009;
 - the $20 million benefit related to the recovery of previously
 expensed engineering and design costs;
 - an increase in equity income earned; and
 - loss on disposal of assets in 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by: - higher incentive compensation;
 - a $20 million stock-based compensation charge as a result of
 modifying option agreements with three departing executives and a
 related $9 million contract termination payment;
 - higher stock-based compensation;
 - a $9 million favourable revaluation of our investment in ABCP in
 2009; and
 - loss on disposal of assets.
 Interest (Income) Expense, net During 2010, we recorded net interest income of $10 million compared to $7 million of net interest expense for 2009. The $17 million increase in net interest income is as a result of: - a reduction in interest expense due to the repayment of our 7.08%
 Subordinated Debentures and our 6.5% Convertible Subordinated
 Debentures during 2009;
 - an increase in interest income earned.
 Operating Income Operating income increased $1.7 billion to income of $1.2 billion for 2010 compared to a loss of $0.5 billion for 2009. Excluding the unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual items"" section, operating income for 2010 increased $1.6 billion. The increase in operating income is the result of the increases in EBIT (excluding unusual items) and net interest income, both as discussed above. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate on operating income (excluding equity income) was 20.3% for 2010 compared to a recovery of 3.5% for 2009. In 2010 and 2009, income tax rates were impacted by the items discussed in the unusual items section. Excluding the unusual items, our effective income tax rate was 20.2% for 2010 compared to a recovery of 6.7% for 2009. Our income tax rate for 2010 reflected more traditional rates as a result of our return to profitability in most jurisdictions. In addition, our effective income tax rate for 2010 was favourably impacted by the utilization of losses previously not benefited, mainly in the United States. Minority Interest During 2010, we recorded $12 million of minority interest recovery with respect to the loss incurred by our E-Car Systems partnership. Net Income Net income increased $1.5 billion to $1.0 billion for 2010 compared to a loss of $0.5 billion for 2009. Excluding the unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual items"" section, net income increased $1.3 billion. The increase in net income is the result of the increase in operating income and minority interest recovery partially offset by higher income taxes, as discussed above.

 Diluted earnings per share increased $6.39 to $4.18 for 2010 compared to a loss of $2.21 for 2009. Excluding the unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual items"" section, diluted earnings per share increased $5.66 from 2009 as a result of the increase in net income (excluding unusual items), described above, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the year. The increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to the net issue of shares during 2010 related to the Arrangement and an increase in the number of diluted shares associated with stock options and restricted stock partially offset by the effect of the repurchase and cancellation of Common Shares in 2010 pursuant to our normal course issuer bid. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash Flow from Operations For the year
 ended December 31,
 ---------------------
 2010 2009 Change

 Cash provided from operating activities $ 1,872 $ 527 $ 1,345
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Cash flow from operations before changes in non-cash operating assets and liabilities increased $1.1 billion to $1.7 billion for 2010 compared to $0.6 billion for 2009. The increase in cash flow from operations was due to a $1.5 billion increase in net income, as discussed above, partially offset by a $0.4 billion decrease in items not involving current cash flows. Items not involving current cash flows are comprised of the following: For the year
 ended December 31,
 -------------------
 2010 2009 Change
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Depreciation and amortization $ 661 $ 737 $ (76)
 Amortization of other assets included

 Curtailment gain - (26) 26
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Items not involving current cash flows $ 722 $ 1,114 $ (392)
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The decrease in items not involving current cash flows was primarily as a result of a $160 million decrease in long-lived asset impairments (as discussed above), a $76 million decrease in depreciation and amortization (as discussed above), a $68 million decrease in future income taxes and non-cash portion of current taxes and a $54 million decrease in other non-cash charges. The decrease in other non-cash charges includes both the previously discussed settlement of commercial items and the sale of facilities. Cash provided from non-cash operating assets and liabilities amounted to $177 million for 2010 compared to cash invested of $94 million for 2009. The change in non-cash operating assets and liabilities is comprised of the following sources (and uses) of cash: For the year
 ended December 31,
 ----------------------
 2010 2009
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Accounts receivable $ (611) $ (40)
 Inventories (178) 17

 Deferred revenue (4) (14)
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Changes in non-cash operating assets
 and liabilities $ 177 $ (94)
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The increases in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable in 2010 was primarily due to the increase in production activities at the end of 2010 compared to the end of 2009, including the launch of new programs which includes complete vehicle assembly of the Peugeot RCZ in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the Aston Martin Rapide in the first quarter of 2010. The increase in income taxes payable was primarily due to a higher income tax provision, resulting from increased earnings, offset by current year tax payments and receipt of tax refunds for prior years.

 Fixed and other assets additions In 2010, we invested $784 million in fixed assets. While investments were made to refurbish or replace assets consumed in the normal course of business and for productivity improvements, a large portion of the investment in 2010 was for manufacturing equipment for programs that will be launching subsequent to 2010. Consistent with our strategy to expand in developing markets, approximately 19% (2009 - 18%) of this investment was in Russia, China, Brazil and India. In 2010, we invested $137 million in other assets related primarily to fully reimbursable tooling costs and planning and engineering costs for programs that will be launching subsequent to 2010. The tooling costs were incurred primarily at our body & chassis systems operations in North America. Purchase of subsidiaries During 2010, we invested $106 million to purchase subsidiaries, including the acquisition of: - Resil Minas, a supplier of seat frames and stampings. The acquired
 business is primarily located in Brazil with sales to various
 customers, including Fiat, Ford, General Motors, Volkswagen, IVECO
 and PSA;
 - Pabsa S.A., a supplier of complete seats, foam products, trim covers
 and seat structures. The acquired business has three production
 facilities in Argentina; and
 - Erhard & Sohne GmbH, a manufacturer of fuel tanks for commercial
 vehicles and other specialty tanks. The acquired business is located
 in Germany and has sales to various customers including MAN, Daimler
 and Scania.
 During 2009, we invested $50 million to purchase subsidiaries, including the acquisition of: - Cadence, a manufacturer of exterior and interior systems. The
 acquired business is primarily located in the Czech Republic with
 sales to various customers, including Skoda; and
 - several facilities from Meridian. The facilities are located in the
 United States and Mexico and manufacture composites for various
 customers.
 Proceeds from disposition Proceeds from disposition in 2010 were $287 million which included: - normal course reimbursement received in respect of planning and
 engineering costs that were capitalized in prior periods;
 - normal course fixed and other asset disposals;
 - a cash payment received on the sale of a long-term receivable related
 to fully reimbursable capitalized pre-production costs;
 - the cash proceeds received on the sale of an electronics facility;
 - a cash payment received on the sale of a long-term engineering
 receivable;
 - gain on sale of investment; and
 - a cash payment received with respect to our investment in ABCP.

In addition, the Stronach group invested $80 million in E-Car. Due to continuing strong operating and cash flow performance, on February 23, 2011 our Board declared a dividend of U.S. $0.25 per share in respect of the fourth quarter of 2010, representing an increase of 39% over the third quarter of 2010 dividend and the third consecutive dividend increase since the reintroduction of the dividend in the first quarter of 2010.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Total capitalization increased by $0.7 billion to $8.2 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to $7.5 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase in capitalization was a result of a $0.7 billion increase in shareholders' equity and a $0.1 billion increase in minority interest partially offset by a $0.1 billion decrease in liabilities. The increase in shareholders' equity was primarily as a result of: - net income earned during 2010;
 - net unrealized gains on cash flow hedges, and the reclassification of
 net gains on cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive
 income to net income;
 - Common Shares issued on the exercise of stock options; and
 - an increase in contributed surplus related to stock-based
 compensation expense.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the repurchase of Class B Shares in connection with the Arrangement;
 - dividends paid during 2010; and
 - the purchase for cancellation of Common Shares in connection with our
 normal course issuer bid.
 The increase in minority interest was as a result of the formation of E-Car. The decrease in liabilities is primarily as a result of the repayment in 2010 of debt assumed on the acquisition of Cadence. Cash Resources During 2010, our cash resources increased by $0.8 billion to $2.1 billion primarily as a result of the cash provided from operating activities partially offset by cash used for investing activities and financing activities (including cash used for the Arrangement), as discussed above. In addition to our cash resources, we had term and operating lines of credit totalling $2.0 billion of which $1.9 billion was unused and available. Maximum Number of Shares Issuable The following table presents the maximum number of shares that would be outstanding if all of the outstanding options at February 23, 2011 were exercised: Common Shares 243,478,976
 Stock options (i) 10,228,090
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 253,707,066
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (i) Options to purchase Common Shares are exercisable by the holder in
 accordance with the vesting provisions and upon payment of the
 exercise price as may be determined from time to time pursuant to our
 stock option plans.
 On November 9, 2010, the Toronto Stock Exchange (""TSX"") accepted our Notice of Intention to Make a Normal Course Issuer Bid relating to the purchase of up to 8,000,000 Magna Common Shares (the ""Bid""), representing 3.3% of our issued and outstanding Common Shares. The Bid commenced on November 11, 2010 and will terminate no later than November 10, 2011. All purchases of Common Shares are made at the market price at the time of purchase in accordance with the rules and policies of the TSX. Purchases may also be made on the NYSE in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Foreign Currency Activities Our North American operations negotiate sales contracts with OEMs for payment in both U.S. and Canadian dollars. Materials and equipment are purchased in various currencies depending upon competitive factors, including relative currency values. The North American operations use labour and materials which are paid for in both U.S. and Canadian dollars. Our Mexican operations generally use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. Our European operations negotiate sales contracts with OEMs for payment principally in euros and British pounds. The European operations' material, equipment and labour are paid for principally in euros and British pounds. We employ hedging programs, primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts, in an effort to manage our foreign exchange exposure, which arises when manufacturing facilities have committed to the delivery of products for which the selling price has been quoted in foreign currencies. These commitments represent our contractual obligations to deliver products over the duration of the product programs, which can last a number of years. The amount and timing of the forward contracts will be dependent upon a number of factors, including anticipated production delivery schedules and anticipated production costs, which may be paid in the foreign currency. In addition, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign exchange exposure with respect to internal funding arrangements. Despite these measures, significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative values of the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, euro or British pound, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition (as discussed throughout this MD&A). RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the fourth quarter of 2010, we posted sales of $6.6 billion, an increase of 22% from the fourth quarter of 2009. This higher sales level was a result of increases in our North American, European and Rest of World production sales, tooling, engineering and other sales and complete vehicle assembly sales. Comparing the fourth quarter of 2010 to the fourth quarter of 2009: - North American vehicle production increased by 7% and average dollar
 content per vehicle increased 17%;
 - European vehicle production increased 7% and average dollar content
 per vehicle increased 6%;
 - Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 19% to $608 million, as
 complete vehicle assembly volumes increased 59%;
 - Rest of World production sales increased 32% to $292 million from
 $221 million; and
 - Tooling, engineering and other sales increased 30% to $710 million
 from $547 million.
 During the fourth quarter of 2010, we generated operating income of $222 million compared to an operating loss of $125 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $242 million increase in operating income was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, operating income was positively impacted by: - lower restructuring and downsizing costs and the benefit of prior
 year restructuring and downsizing activities;
 - a $24 million recovery, during the fourth quarter of 2010, of
 receivables that had a $16 million accounts receivable valuation
 allowance recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009;
 - lower costs incurred related to launches at our Complete Vehicle
 Assembly operations;
 - the write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related
 to the cancellation of assembly programs in 2009;
 - due diligence costs incurred in 2009 associated with our planned
 investment in Opel, which terminated during 2009;
 - lower warranty costs; and
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities.
 These factors were partially offset by: - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities,
 in particular at certain exteriors and interiors systems facilities
 in Europe;
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - higher costs incurred related to launches at our components
 operations, in particular in North America and China;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - a $4 million stock-based compensation charge as a result of modifying
 option agreements with a departing executive and a related $9 million
 contract termination payment;
 - increased stock-based compensation; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the fourth quarter of
 2009.
 During the fourth quarter of 2010, net income increased $355 million to $216 million compared to a net loss of $139 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased $248 million. The increase in net income was a result of the increase in operating income and minority interest recovery partially offset by higher income taxes. During the fourth quarter of 2010, our diluted earnings per share increased by $1.50 to $0.88 compared to diluted loss per share of $0.62 for the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased by $1.01. The increase in diluted earnings per share is as a result of the increase in net income (excluding unusual items) partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to the net issue of shares during the third quarter of 2010 related to the Arrangement and an increase in the number of diluted shares associated with stock options and restricted stock partially offset by the effect of the repurchase and cancellation of Common Shares during the fourth quarter of 2010 pursuant to our normal course issuer bid.

 External Production Sales - North America External production sales in North America increased 25% or $0.6 billion to $3.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $2.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 7% increase in North American vehicle production volumes combined with a 17% increase in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. Our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 17% or $147 to $1,015 for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $868 for the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the fourth quarter
 of 2009, including the:
 - Jeep Grand Cherokee;
 - BWM X3;
 - Ford Fiesta;
 - Chevrolet Cruze; and
 - Ford Explorer;
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain;
 - GM full-sized pickups and SUVs;
 - Jeep Wrangler;
 - Ram Pickup;
 - Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX; and
 - Mercedes-Benz M-Class, R-Class and GL-Class; and
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening of
 the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar.
 These factors were partially offset by: - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the fourth
 quarter of 2009, including the Mercury, Pontiac and Saturn brands;
 - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - Ford Flex;
 - Dodge Avenger and Chrysler Sebring; and
 - Lincoln MKT; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the fourth quarter of
 2009.
 External Production Sales - Europe External production sales in Europe increased 14% or $0.23 billion to $1.96 billion for fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $1.72 billion for fourth quarter of 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 7% increase in European vehicle production volumes combined with a 6% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. Our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 6% or $30 to $553 for fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $523 for the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to fourth quarter of
 2009, including the:
 - MINI Countryman;
 - Audi A1;
 - Porsche Cayenne and Volkswagen Touareg;
 - Mercedes-Benz SLS; and
 - Peugeot RCZ; and
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - Volkswagen Transporter; and
 - Mercedes-Benz C-Class.
 These factors were partially offset by: - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the
 euro, against the U.S. dollar;
 - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the MINI Cooper;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the fourth
 quarter of 2009, including the BMW X3; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the fourth quarter of
 2009.
 External Production Sales - Rest of World External production sales in Rest of World increased 32% or $71 million to $292 million for fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $221 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - increased production and/or content on certain programs in China,
 Korea, Brazil and South Africa;
 - the acquisition of a Japanese roof systems facility in the first
 quarter of 2010; and
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the fourth quarter
 of 2009 in China and Korea.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the sale of our interest in an electronics systems joint venture in
 China in the first quarter of 2010; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2009.

 North America EBIT in North America increased $167 million to $260 million for fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $93 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding the North American unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $144 million increase in EBIT was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - lower restructuring and downsizing costs and the benefit of prior
 year restructuring and downsizing activities;
 - lower warranty costs;
 - gain on sale of investment;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities; and
 - a $6 million recovery, during the fourth quarter of 2010, of
 receivables that had a $3 million accounts receivable valuation
 allowance recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by: - higher incentive compensation;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher costs incurred related to launches;
 - higher affiliation fees paid to Corporate;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the fourth quarter of
 2009.
 Europe EBIT in Europe increased $201 million to $4 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $197 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding the European unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $119 million increase in EBIT was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - lower restructuring and downsizing costs and the benefit of prior
 year restructuring and downsizing activities;
 - an $18 million recovery, during the fourth quarter of 2010, of
 receivables that had a $13 million accounts receivable valuation
 allowance recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009;
 - the write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related
 to the cancellation of assembly programs in 2009; and
 - lower costs incurred related to launches at our Complete Vehicle
 Assembly operations.
 These factors were partially offset by: - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities, in
 particular at certain exteriors and interiors systems facilities;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - higher affiliation fees paid to Corporate;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher costs incurred related to launches at our components
 business, in particular Russia;
 - higher warranty costs;
 - higher incentive compensation; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the fourth quarter of
 2009.
 Rest of World EBIT in Rest of World decreased $2 million to $16 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $18 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - higher launch costs related to new facilities, primarily in Korea,
 Brazil and India;
 - the write-off of certain assets;
 - higher warranty costs;
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2009; and
 - the sale of our interest in an electronics systems joint venture in
 China in the first quarter of 2010.
 These factors were partially offset by: - additional margin earned on increased production sales; and
 - incremental margin earned on new programs that launched during or
 subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2009.
 E-Car Systems E-Car Systems EBIT decreased $24 million to a loss of $37 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $13 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of higher development and launch costs. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other EBIT increased $2 million to a loss of $25 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $27 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - an increase in affiliation fees earned from our divisions;
 - due diligence costs incurred in 2009 associated with our planned
 investment in Opel, which terminated during 2009; and
 - loss on disposal of assets in 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by: - increased incentive compensation;
 - a $4 million stock-based compensation charge as a result of modifying
 option agreements with a departing executive and a related $9 million
 contract termination payment;
 - increased stock-based compensation; and
 - loss on disposal of assets. FUTURE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- In February 2008, the Canadian Accounting Standards Board confirmed the transition from Canadian GAAP to International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") for all publicly accountable entities no later than for fiscal years commencing on or after January 1, 2011. As a result, throughout 2009, we undertook a detailed review of the implications of having to report under IFRS and also examined the alternative available to us, as a Foreign Private Issuer in the United States, of filing our primary financial statements in Canada using U.S. GAAP, as permitted by the Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 51-102, ''Continuous Disclosure Obligations''. In carrying out this evaluation, we considered many factors, including, but not limited to (i) the changes in accounting policies that would be required and the resulting impact on our reported results and key performance indicators, (ii) the reporting standards expected to be used by many of our industry comparables, and (iii) the financial reporting needs of our market participants, including shareholders, lenders, rating agencies and market analysts. As a result of this analysis, we have determined that we will adopt U.S. GAAP as our primary basis of financial reporting with our first reporting period beginning after January 1, 2011. The adoption of U.S. GAAP is not anticipated to have a material change on our accounting policies or financial results, except for the reporting differences disclosed in note 26 of our 2009 consolidated financial statements. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- From time to time, we may be contingently liable for litigation and other claims. Refer to note 24 of our 2009 audited consolidated financial statements, which describes these claims. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- The previous discussion contains statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of applicable securities legislation, including, but not limited to, statements relating to: future purchases of our Common Shares pursuant to our normal course issuer bid and any resultant offsetting of dilution; expected North American, European and global light vehicle production; implementation of our strategy, including through organic growth and targeted acquisitions; and renewal of our current credit facility. The forward-looking information in this Press Release is presented for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward-looking statements may include financial and other projections, as well as statements regarding our future plans, objectives or economic performance, or the assumptions underlying any of the foregoing, and other statements that are not recitations of historical fact. We use words such as ""may"", ""would"", ""could"", ""should"", ""will"", ""likely"", ""expect"", ""anticipate"", ""believe"", ""intend"", ""plan"", ""forecast"", ""outlook"", ""project"", ""estimate"" and similar expressions suggesting future outcomes or events to identify forward-looking statements. Any such forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and are based on assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and our perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors we believe are appropriate in the circumstances. However, whether actual results and developments will conform with our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks, assumptions and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and the effects of which can be difficult to predict, including, without limitation: the potential for a slower than anticipated economic recovery or a deterioration of economic conditions; a significant decline in production volumes from current levels and sales levels which are below forecast levels; the inability of suppliers to timely accommodate significant, rapid increases in production volumes; our dependence on outsourcing by our customers; the termination or non renewal by our customers of any material contracts; our ability to identify and successfully exploit shifts in technology; restructuring, downsizing and/or other significant non-recurring costs; impairment charges; our ability to successfully grow our sales to non-traditional customers; unfavourable product or customer mix; risks of conducting business in foreign countries, including China, India, Brazil, Russia and other developing markets; our ability to quickly shift our manufacturing footprint to take advantage of lower cost manufacturing opportunities; our ability to secure sufficient amounts of capital to meet our liquidity requirements on favourable terms, disruptions in the capital and credit markets; the deteriorating economic condition of several European governments and the potential adverse effect on the global economy; fluctuations in relative currency values; exposure to escalating commodities prices; our ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions; pricing pressures, including our ability to offset price concessions demanded by our customers; warranty and recall costs; the financial condition and credit worthiness of some of our OEM customers, including the potential that such customers may not make, or may seek to delay or reduce, payments owed to us; the financial condition of some of our suppliers and the risk of their insolvency, bankruptcy or financial restructuring; the highly competitive nature of the automotive parts supply business; product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage; changes in our mix of earnings between jurisdictions with lower tax rates and those with higher tax rates, as well as our ability to fully benefit tax losses; other potential tax exposures; legal claims against us; work stoppages and labour relations disputes; changes in laws and governmental regulations; costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations; risks associated with our pursuit of opportunities in complementary ""non-automotive"" businesses; risks associated with our partnership, Magna E-Car Systems, with the Stronach group to continue to pursue opportunities in the vehicle electrification business; and other factors set out in our Annual Information Form filed with securities commissions in Canada and our annual report on Form 40-F filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and subsequent filings, including, without limitation, factors set out in our Management Information Circular/Proxy Statement, dated May 31, 2010 under the heading ""Risks Relating to the Vehicle Electrification Joint Venture"" and ""Risks to Magna of the E-Car Business"". In evaluating forward-looking statements, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements and readers should specifically consider the various factors which could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. Unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, we do not intend, nor do we undertake any obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent information, events, results or circumstances or otherwise.

 See accompanying notes MAGNA INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Unaudited)(All amounts in U.S. dollars and all tabular amounts in millions unlessotherwise noted)------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESBasis of presentation
 The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Magna
 International Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively ""Magna"" or the
 ""Company"") have been prepared in United States dollars following
 Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") with
 respect to the preparation of interim financial information.
 Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes
 required in the preparation of annual financial statements and
 therefore should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2009
 audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the
 Company's 2009 Annual Report. These interim consolidated financial
 statements have been prepared using the same accounting policies as
 the December 31, 2009 annual consolidated financial statements.
 In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated
 financial statements reflect all adjustments, which consist only of
 normal and recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the
 financial position at December 31, 2010 and the results of operations
 and cash flows for the three-months and years ended December 31, 2010
 and 2009.
 Stock Split
 On November 24, 2010, the Company completed a two-for-one stock
 split, which was implemented by way of a stock dividend, whereby
 shareholders received an additional Common Share for each Common
 Share held. All equity-based compensation plans or arrangements were
 adjusted to reflect the issuance of additional Common Shares.
 Accordingly, all of the Company's issued and outstanding Class A
 Subordinate Voting, Common and Class B shares, including those issued
 in relation to the Arrangement (note 2), incentive stock options,
 and stock appreciation rights (""SARs"") have been restated for all
 periods presented to reflect the stock split. In addition, earnings
 (loss) per Common Share or Class B Share, Cash dividends paid per
 Common Share or Class B Share, weighted average exercise price for
 stock options and the weighted average fair value of options granted
 or modified have been restated for all periods presented to reflect
 the stock split.
 Seasonality
 Our businesses are generally not seasonal. However, our sales and
 profits are closely related to our automotive customers' vehicle
 production schedules. Our largest North American customers typically
 halt production for approximately two weeks in July and one week in
 December. Additionally, many of our customers in Europe typically
 shutdown vehicle production during portions of August and one week in
 December. 2. PLAN OF ARRANGEMENT On August 31, 2010, following approval by the Class A Subordinate
 Voting and Class B Shareholders, the Company completed a court-
 approved plan of arrangement (the ""Arrangement"") in which the
 Company's dual-class share structure was collapsed. In addition,
 the transaction: (i) set a termination date and declining fee
 schedule for the consulting, business development and business
 services contracts Magna has in place with its Chairman, Frank
 Stronach and his affiliated entities; and (ii) established a
 partnership with the Stronach group to pursue opportunities in the
 vehicle electrification business.
 (a) Capital Transaction
 The Company purchased for cancellation all 1,453,658
 outstanding Class B Shares (restated to reflect the stock
 split), which were held indirectly by the Stronach group, for
 $300 million in cash and 18.0 million newly issued Class A
 Subordinate Voting Shares (restated to reflect the stock
 split). The newly issued shares held indirectly by the Stronach
 group represented an equal equity ownership and voting interest
 of 7.4% as of August 31, 2010. The costs related to the
 Arrangement were $10 million, net of tax.
 In addition, Magna's Articles were amended to remove the Class
 B Shares from the authorized capital and to make non-substantive
 consequential changes, including renaming the Class A
 Subordinate Voting Shares as Common Shares and eliminating
 provisions which no longer apply due to the elimination of
 the Class B Shares.
 (b) Vehicle Electrification Partnership
 The partnership, Magna E-Car Systems (""E-Car""), involves the
 engineering, development and integration of electric vehicles of
 any type, the development, testing and manufacturing of
 batteries and battery packs for hybrid and electric vehicles and
 all ancillary activities in connection with electric vehicle
 technologies. Magna's original investment in the partnership
 included the assets of the Company's recently established E-Car
 Systems vehicle electrification and battery business unit,
 certain other vehicle electrification assets, and $145 million
 in cash. On August 31, 2010, the Stronach group invested $80
 million in cash for a 27% equity interest in the partnership,
 reducing Magna's equity interest to 73%. The partnership is
 controlled by the Stronach group.
 The impact of the Arrangement on the August 31, 2010 consolidated
 balance sheet was as follows (restated to reflect the stock split):

 (a) North America
 For the year ended December 31, 2010
 During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company recorded long-lived
 asset impairment charges of $7 million ($5 million after tax) related
 to a die casting facility in Canada. In addition, the Company
 recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $8 million
 ($6 million after tax) in costs of goods sold related to the planned
 closure of a powertrain systems facility the United States.
 During the second quarter of 2010, the Company recorded restructuring
 and rationalization costs of $21 million ($18 million after tax) in
 costs of goods sold and $3 million ($3 million after tax) in selling,
 general and administrative expense related to the planned closure of
 a powertrain systems facility and two body & chassis systems
 facilities in the United States, substantially all of which will
 be paid subsequent to 2010.
 For the year ended December 31, 2009
 In conjunction with its annual business planning cycle, during the
 fourth quarter of 2009 the Company determined that its Car Top
 Systems (""CTS"") North America reporting unit could potentially be
 impaired, primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic reduction in the
 market for soft tops, hard tops and modular retractable hard tops;
 and (ii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout
 the Company's business planning period. Based on the reporting unit's
 discounted forecast cashflows, the Company recorded a $25 million
 goodwill impairment charge.
 In addition, during the second quarter of 2009, after failing to
 reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain facility in
 Syracuse, New York, the Company decided to wind down these
 operations. Given the significance of the facility's cashflows in
 relation to the reporting unit, management determined that it was
 more likely than not that goodwill at the Powertrain North America
 reporting unit could potentially be impaired. Therefore, the Company
 recorded a $75 million goodwill impairment charge.
 The goodwill impairment charges were calculated by determining the
 implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if it had
 acquired the Powertrain and CTS reporting units as at June 30, 2009
 and December 31, 2009, respectively.
 During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded long-lived
 asset impairment charges of $13 million ($11 million after tax)
 related to fixed assets at a die casting facility in Canada and an
 anticipated under recovery of capitalized tooling costs at a stamping
 facility in the United States due to significantly lower volumes on
 certain SUV programs.
 During the second quarter of 2009, the Company recorded restructuring
 costs of $6 million in cost of goods sold ($6 million after tax)
 related to the planned closure of a powertrain facility in Syracuse,
 New York, substantially all of which remains to be paid subsequent
 to 2010.
 (b) Europe
 For the year ended December 31, 2010
 During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company recorded long-lived
 asset impairment charges of $16 million ($16 million after tax)
 related to an interiors systems facility in Germany.
 For the year ended December 31, 2009
 During 2009, the Company recorded long-lived assets impairment
 charges of $70 million ($70 million after tax) related to its CTS and
 exterior systems operations in Germany.
 At the Company's CTS operations, long-lived asset impairment charges
 of $59 million ($59 million after tax) were recorded related to fixed
 and intangible assets. The impairment charge was calculated based on
 the CTS' discounted forecast cashflows and was necessary primarily as
 a result of: (i) a dramatic reduction in the market for soft tops,
 hard tops and modular retractable hard tops; and (ii) historical
 losses that are projected to continue throughout the Company's
 business planning period.
 At its exteriors operations, the Company recorded an $11 million
 ($11 million after tax) asset impairment charge related to specific
 under-utilized assets in Germany.
 During 2009, the Company recorded restructuring and rationalization
 costs of $17 million in cost of goods sold and $3 million in selling,
 general and administrative expense ($20 million after tax). The
 charges consist primarily of severance and other termination benefits
 related to the closure of powertrain and interior systems facilities
 in Germany. 4. DETAILS OF CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES(a) Cash and cash equivalents:

 2009 would no longer participate in the plan. The amendment
 reduced service costs and retirement medical benefit expense in
 2009 and future years. As a result of amending the plan, a
 curtailment gain of $26 million was recorded in cost of goods
 sold in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009. 9. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION(a) Incentive Stock Option Plan

 (i) The exercise price noted above represents the weighted average
 exercise price in Canadian dollars.
 (ii) On November 8, 2010, options to acquire 386,666 Common Shares were
 surrendered for cancellation in exchange for payment of the
 in-the-money value of such options on such date. The aggregate
 in-the-money value of the options surrendered was $8 million and
 was charged to contributed surplus (note 11).
 On August 19, 2010, options to acquire 243,000 Common Shares were
 surrendered for cancellation in exchange for payment of the
 in-the-money value of such options on such date. The aggregate
 in-the-money value of the options surrendered was $4 million and
 was charged to contributed surplus (note 11).
 On August 12, 2009, following approval by the Company's Corporate
 Governance and Compensation Committee and in accordance with the
 Amended and Restated Incentive Stock Option Plan, the Company
 granted SARs to certain executives in respect of 383,400
 previously granted and unexercised stock options.
 On August 14, 2009, 332,822 SARs were exercised and an equal
 number of previously granted and unexercised stock options were
 surrendered and cancelled. On exercise of the SARs, the executives
 received, in aggregate, cash of $1 million, representing an amount
 equal to the difference between the aggregate fair market value of
 the shares covered by the surrendered options and the aggregate
 exercise price of such surrendered options.
 The weighted average assumptions used in measuring the fair value of
 stock options granted and/or modified and the compensation expense
 recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses are as
 follows:
 Three months

 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 Weighted average fair value

 (restated) $ 12.46 $ - $ 10.00 $ 3.60
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 During 2010, option agreements with three departing employees
 were modified resulting in a charge to compensation expense in
 the third and fourth quarters of 2010 of $16 million and
 $4 million, respectively. This charge represents the fair value
 of the options at the date of modification net of originally
 measured compensation cost which has been reversed.
 Compensation expense recorded in selling, general and
 administrative expenses during the three months and year ended
 December 31, 2010 was $10 million (2009 - $2 million), and
 $43 million (2009 - $4 million), respectively.
 (b) Long-term retention program

 (b) Fair value
 The Company determined the estimated fair values of its financial
 instruments based on valuation methodologies it believes are
 appropriate; however, considerable judgment is required to
 develop these estimates. Accordingly, these estimated fair values
 are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could
 realize in a current market exchange. The estimated fair value
 amounts can be materially affected by the use of different
 assumptions or methodologies. The methods and assumptions used to
 estimate the fair value of financial instruments are described
 below:
 Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, bank indebtedness
 and accounts payable.
 Due to the short period to maturity of the instruments, the
 carrying values as presented in the consolidated balance sheets
 are reasonable estimates of fair values.
 Investments
 At December 31, 2010, the Company held Canadian third party
 asset-backed commercial paper (""ABCP"") with a face value of
 Cdn$127 million (December 31, 2009 - Cdn$134 million). The
 carrying value and estimated fair value of this investment was
 Cdn$84 million (December 31, 2009 - Cdn$88 million). As fair
 value information is not readily determinable for the Company's
 investment in ABCP, the fair value was based on a valuation
 technique estimating the fair value from the perspective of a
 market participant.
 At December 31, 2010, the Company held equity investments in
 publicly traded companies. The carrying value and fair value of
 these investments was $19 million, which was based on the closing
 share price of the investments on December 31, 2010.
 Term debt
 The Company's term debt includes $25 million due within one year.
 Due to the short period to maturity of this debt, the carrying
 value as presented in the consolidated balance sheet is a
 reasonable estimate of its fair value.
 (c) Credit risk
 The Company's financial assets that are exposed to credit risk
 consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
 receivable, long-term receivables, held to maturity investments,
 and foreign exchange forward contracts with positive fair values.
 The Company's held for trading investments include an investment
 in ABCP. Given the continuing uncertainties regarding the value
 of the underlying assets, the amount and timing over cash flows
 and the risk of collateral calls in the event that spreads
 widened considerably, the Company could be exposed to further
 losses on its investment.
 Cash and cash equivalents, which consist of short-term
 investments, are only invested in governments, bank term deposits
 and bank commercial paper with an investment grade credit rating.
 Credit risk is further reduced by limiting the amount which is
 invested in certain governments or any major financial
 institution.
 The Company is also exposed to credit risk from the potential
 default by any of its counterparties on its derivative
 instruments. The Company mitigates this credit risk by dealing
 with counterparties who are major financial institutions that the
 Company anticipates will satisfy their obligations under the
 contracts.
 In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to
 credit risk from its customers, substantially all of which are in
 the automotive industry and are subject to credit risks
 associated with the automotive industry. For the three months and
 year ended December 31, 2010, sales to the Company's six largest
 customers represented 85% and 81% of the Company's total sales,
 respectively, and substantially all of our sales are to customers
 in which the Company has ongoing contractual relationships.
 (d) Currency risk
 The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates
 when manufacturing facilities have committed to the delivery of
 products for which the selling price has been quoted in
 currencies other than the facilities' functional currency, or
 when materials and equipment are purchased in currencies other
 than the facilities' functional currency. In an effort to manage
 this net foreign exchange exposure, the Company employs hedging
 programs, primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward
 contracts.
 As at December 31, 2010, the net foreign exchange exposure was
 not material.
 (e) Interest rate risk
 The Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk due
 to the short-term maturity of its monetary current assets and
 current liabilities. In particular, the amount of interest income
 earned on our cash and cash equivalents is impacted more by the
 investment decisions made and the demands to have available cash
 on hand, than by movements in the interest rates over a given
 period.
 In addition, the Company is not exposed to interest rate risk on
 its term debt instruments as the interest rates on these
 instruments are fixed. 15. SEGMENTED INFORMATION In conjunction with the completion of the Arrangement, the Company's
 E-Car Systems partnership is managed separately from the Company's
 other operations which continue to be segmented on a geographic basis
 between North America, Europe, and Rest of World. Consistent with the
 above, the Company's internal financial reporting has been revised to
 separately segment key internal operating performance measures
 between North America, Europe, Rest of World and E-Car Systems for
 purposes of presentation to the chief operating decision maker to
 assist in the assessment of operating performance, the allocation of
 resources, and the long-term strategic direction and future global
 growth of the Company. The Company's reporting to Magna's Corporate
 Executive Team, Board of Directors and shareholders has also been
 revised accordingly.

As at December 31, 2010, We had 256 manufacturing operations and 82 product development, engineering and sales centres in 26 countries. HIGHLIGHTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operations 2010 was a year of significant change for both the automotive industry and Magna. North American light vehicle production increased 39% in 2010, compared to the historically low level of production experienced in 2009. The key reason for this increase in North American light vehicle production was the improvement in North American auto sales. In Western Europe, light vehicle production increased 12% in 2010, compared to 2009. The increased production in 2010 reflected relatively strong vehicle sales in certain European countries, as well as increased exports of European-built vehicles into other markets during 2010, particularly China. Our 2010 total sales increased 39% over 2009, with North American, European and Rest of World production sales, as well as complete vehicle assembly sales, and tooling and other sales all posting increases over 2009. Rest of World production sales exceeded the $1 billion mark for the first time, increasing 53% in 2010 to $1.031 billion, compared to $676 million in 2009. Operating income for 2010 increased $1.7 billion to $1.2 billion, compared to an operating loss of $511 million for 2009. Diluted earnings per share for 2010 increased $6.39 to $4.18, compared to a diluted loss per share of $2.21 for 2009. Cash flow from operations for 2010 increased $1.3 billion to $1.87 billion, compared to $527 million for 2009. Our 2010 financial results reflect, among other things: - the improved level of light vehicle production in North America and
 Western Europe;
 - the benefits of Our efforts over the last few years to restructure,
 right-size and otherwise reduce costs across the organization; and
 - the benefit of Our efforts to improve underperforming operations
 around the world.
 Plan of Arrangement On August 31, 2010, following approval by Our Class A Subordinate Voting and Class B Shareholders, Our completed a court-approved plan of arrangement (the ""Arrangement"") in which our dual-class share structure was collapsed. In addition, the transaction: (i) set a termination date and declining fee schedule for the consulting, business development and business services contracts ABOUT MAGNA has in place with Our Chairman, Frank Stronach, and his affiliated entities; and (ii) established a partnership with the Stronach group to pursue opportunities in the vehicle electrification business. (a) Capital Transaction
 Our purchased for cancellation all 1,453,658 outstanding Class B
 Shares (restated to reflect the stock split discussed below), which
 were held indirectly by the Stronach group, for $300 million in cash
 and 18.0 million newly issued Class A Subordinate Voting Shares
 (restated to reflect the stock split discussed below). all 1,453,658 outstanding Class B
 Shares (restated to reflect the stock split discussed below), which
 were held indirectly by the Stronach group, for $300 million in cash
 and 18.0 million newly issued Class A Subordinate Voting Shares
 (restated to reflect the stock split discussed below) represented an
 equal equity ownership and voting interest of 7.4% as of August 31,
 2010.
 In addition, ABOUT MAGNA's Articles were amended to remove all 1,453,658 outstanding Class B
 Shares (restated to reflect the stock split discussed below), which
 were held indirectly by the Stronach group, for $300 million in cash
 and 18.0 million newly issued Class A Subordinate Voting Shares
 (restated to reflect the stock split discussed below) from the authorized capital and to make non-substantive
 consequential changes, including renaming the Class A Subordinate
 Voting Shares as Common Shares and eliminating provisions which no
 longer apply due to the elimination of the Class B Shares.
 (b) Vehicle Electrification Partnership
 The partnership, Magna E-Car Systems (""E-Car""), involves the
 engineering, development and integration of electric vehicles of any
 type, the development, testing and manufacturing of batteries and
 battery packs for hybrid and electric vehicles and all
 ancillary activities in connection with electric vehicle
 technologies. Our original investment in (b) Vehicle Electrification Partnership
  included the
 assets of Our recently established E-Car Systems vehicle
 electrification and battery business unit, certain other vehicle
 electrification assets, and $145 million in cash. On August 31, 2010,
 the Stronach group invested $80 million in cash for a 27% equity
 interest in (b) Vehicle Electrification Partnership
 , reducing our equity interest to 73%. (b) Vehicle Electrification Partnership
  is controlled by the Stronach group.
 Stock Split On November 24, 2010, Our completed a two-for-one stock split, which was implemented by way of a stock dividend. In connection with the stock split, all equity-based compensation plans or arrangements were adjusted to reflect the issuance of additional Common Shares. Accordingly, all of Our issued and outstanding Common Shares and Our former Class A Subordinate Voting and Class B shares, including the shares issued in connection with the Arrangement, as well as incentive stock options, and stock appreciation rights (""SARs"") have been restated for all periods presented to reflect the stock split. In addition, earnings (loss) per Common Share or Class B Share, cash dividends paid per Common Share or Class B Share, weighted average exercise price for stock options and the weighted average fair value of options granted or modified have been restated for all periods presented to reflect the stock split. Dividends Due to continuing strong operating and cash flow performance, on February 23, 2011 our Board declared a dividend of U.S. $0.25 per share in respect of the fourth quarter of 2010, representing an increase of 39% over the third quarter of 2010 dividend and the third consecutive dividend increase since the reintroduction of the dividend in the first quarter of 2010. Normal Course Issuer Bid On November 4, 2010, our Board of Directors approved a normal course issuer bid to purchase up to 8.0 million of our issued and outstanding Common Shares (adjusted to reflect the stock split), representing approximately 3.3% of our outstanding Common Shares. The primary purposes of the normal course issuer bid are purchases for cancellation to offset potential dilution resulting from the exercise of stock options and/or to fund our restricted stock unit program and our obligations to our deferred profit sharing plans. the normal course issuer bid will terminate in November 2011. Governance Since the elimination of our dual-class share structure effective August 31, 2010, our have implemented a number of significant corporate governance initiatives, including the: - adoption of a majority voting policy;
 - reconstitution of the Nominating Committee of our Board of Directorsas a fully independent Committee; and
 - initiation of a search for additional independent directors with the
 assistance of an internationally recognized firm.
 Acquisitions Consistent with our strategy to expand in new regions, in December 2010, our acquired seating companies in Brazil and Argentina. Combined 2010 sales in the two seating companies amounted to $260 million. Also during December 2010, our acquired Erhard & Sohne GmbH, a manufacturer of fuel tanks. Going Forward Following a strong rebound in 2010, we expect global light vehicle production to grow further in 2011, provided that overall economic conditions continue to improve. In North America, light vehicle production should experience strong growth in 2011, although production remains well off peak levels. In Western Europe, we expect light vehicle production to be approximately level with 2010. we strategy includes: - continued expansion in high growth and developing markets;
 - increased investment in innovation to remain at the forefront of the
 automotive industry;
 - further diversification of sales by customer, by region and by
 vehicle segment; and
 - continued support of our existing customers globally.
 we expect Our strategy to be implemented both through organic growth as well as targeted acquisitions. FINANCIAL RESULTS SUMMARY ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During 2010, we posted sales of $24.1 billion, an increase of 39% from 2009. This higher sales level was a result of increases in we North American, European and Rest of World production sales, complete vehicle assembly sales and tooling, engineering and other sales. Comparing 2010 to 2009: - North American vehicle production increased by 39% and average dollar
 content per vehicle increased 13%;
 - European vehicle production increased 12% and average dollar content
 per vehicle increased 8%;
 - Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 23% to $2.2 billion, as
 complete vehicle assembly volumes increased 52%;
 - Rest of World production sales increased 53% to $1.0 billion from
 $0.7 billion; and
 - Tooling, engineering and other sales increased 26% to $2.0 billion
 from $1.6 billion.
 During 2010, we earned operating income of $1.2 billion compared to an operating loss of $0.5 billion for 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2010 and 2009, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $1.6 billion increase in operating income was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, operating income was positively impacted by: - lower restructuring and downsizing costs and the benefit of prior
 year restructuring and downsizing activities;
 - a $32 million recovery, during 2010, of receivables that were fully
 provided for in 2009;
 - favourable settlement of certain commercial items;
 - the write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related
 to the cancellation of assembly programs in 2009;
 - higher equity income;
 - due diligence costs incurred in 2009 associated with our planned
 investment in Opel, which terminated during 2009;
 - the $20 million benefit related to the recovery of previously
 expensed engineering and design costs;
 - higher interest income;
 - incremental margin earned on acquisitions completed during or
 subsequent to 2009, including Cadence Innovation s.r.o. (""Cadence"");
 - lower costs incurred related to launches at our Complete Vehicle
 Assembly operations; and
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities.
 These factors were partially offset by: - higher incentive compensation;
 - higher costs related to launches at our components business;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities, in
 particular at certain exteriors and interiors systems facilities in
 Europe;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - a $20 million stock-based compensation charge as a result of
 modifying option agreements with three departing executives and a
 related $9 million contract termination payment;
 - increased stock-based compensation;
 - a $9 million favourable revaluation of our investment in asset-backed
 commercial paper (""ABCP"") in 2009; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2009.
 During 2010, net income increased $1.5 billion to $1.0 billion compared to net loss of $0.5 billion for 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2010 and 2009, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income for 2010 increased $1.3 billion. The increase in net income was a result of the increase in operating income and minority interest recovery, partially offset by higher income taxes. During 2010, our diluted earnings per share increased by $6.39 to $4.18 compared to loss per share of $2.21 for 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2010 and 2009, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, diluted earnings per share for 2010 increased by $5.66. The increase in diluted earnings per share is as a result of the increase in net income partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during 2010. The increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to the net issue of shares during 2010 related primarily to the Arrangement and an increase in the number of diluted shares associated with stock options and restricted stock partially offset by the effect of the repurchase and cancellation of Common Shares pursuant to our normal course issuer bid.

 (a) For the year ended December 31, 2010
 (i) Long-lived Assets
 In conjunction with our annual business planning cycle,
 during the fourth quarter of 2010, our completed our annual
 goodwill impairment and long-lived asset analysis and
 recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $23 million.
 In North America, our recorded charges of $7 million related
 to fixed assets at a die casting facility in Canada and in
 Germany, our recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of
 $16 million related to an interiors systems facility.
 (ii) Restructuring Costs
 During 2010, our recorded restructuring and rationalization
 costs of $29 million in cost of goods sold and $3 million in
 selling, general and administrative expense related to the
 planned closure of a powertrain systems facility and two
 body & chassis systems facilities in North America.
 (b) For the year ended December 31, 2009
 (i) Goodwill
 In conjunction with our annual business planning cycle,
 during the fourth quarter of 2009 our determined that our Car
 Top Systems (""CTS"") North America reporting unit could
 potentially be impaired, primarily as a result of: (i) a
 dramatic reduction in the market for soft tops, hard tops
 and modular retractable hard tops; and (ii) historical
 losses that are projected to continue throughout our
 business planning period. Based on the reporting unit's
 discounted forecast cashflows, our recorded a $25 million
 goodwill impairment charge.
 In addition, during the second quarter of 2009, after
 failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a
 powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York, we
 decided to wind down a
 powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York. Given the
 significance of the facility's cashflows in relation to the
 reporting unit, management determined that it was more
 likely than not that goodwill at North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired.
 Therefore, we
  recorded a $75 million goodwill impairment
 charge.
 The goodwill impairment charges were calculated by
 determining the implied fair value of goodwill in the same
 manner as if we
  had acquired the Powertrain and CTS
 reporting units as at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009,
 respectively.
 (ii) Long-lived Assets
 During the fourth quarter of 2009 we recorded long-lived
 asset impairment charges of $83 million.
 In North America, we recorded charges of $13 million related
 to fixed assets at a die casting facility in Canada and an
 anticipated under recovery of capitalized tooling costs at a
 stamping facility in the United States due to significantly
 lower volumes on certain SUV programs.
 In Western Europe, we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges
 of $70 million related to we CTS and exterior systems
 operations in Germany.
 At we CTS operations, long-lived asset impairment charges
 of $59 million were recorded related to fixed and intangible
 assets. The impairment charge was calculated based on CTSdiscounted forecast cashflows and was necessary primarily as
 a result of: (i) a dramatic reduction in the market for soft
 tops, hard tops and modular retractable hard tops; and (ii)
 historical losses that are projected to continue throughout
 we business planning period.
 At we interiors and exteriors operations, we recorded an
 $11 million asset impairment charge related to specific
 under-utilized assets in Germany.
 (iii) Restructuring Costs
 During 2009, we recorded restructuring and rationalization
 costs of $23 million in cost of goods sold and $3 million in
 selling, general and administrative expense. During the
 second quarter, we recorded restructuring costs of $6
 million related to the planned closure of a powertrain
 systems facility in Syracuse, New York New York and during the fourth
 quarter we recorded severance and other termination benefits
 related to the closure of powertrain and interior systems
 facilities in Germany. Substantially all of the $26 million
 will be paid subsequent to 2009.
 In addition, during 2009, we incurred costs related to
 downsizing various operations in we traditional markets.
 (2) Sale of Facilities
 During 2010, we sold we interest in an electronics systems joint
 venture in China and realized a $14 million gain.
 During 2009, we entered into an agreement to sell an engineering
 centre in Western Europe and, as a result, incurred a loss on disposition of
 the facility of $8 million.
 (3) Curtailment gain
 During the second quarter of 2009, we amended we Retiree Premium
 Reimbursement Plan in Canada and the United States, such that most
 employees retiring on or after August 1, 2009 would no longer
 participate in the plan. The amendment reduced service costs and
 retirement medical benefit expense in 2009 and future years. As a
 result of amending the plan, a curtailment gain of $26 million was
 recorded in cost of goods sold in the second quarter of 2009. INDUSTRY TRENDS AND RISKS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- A number of general trends which have been impacting the automotive industry and our business in recent years are expected to continue, including the following: - the exertion of pricing pressure by OEMs;
 - government incentives and consumer demand for, and industry focus on,
 more fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly vehicles with
 alternative-energy fuel systems and additional safety features;
 - governmental regulation of fuel economy and emissions, vehicle
 recyclability and vehicle safety;
 - the long-term growth of the automotive industry in China, India,
 Brazil, Russia and other developing markets, including accelerated
 migration of component and vehicle design, development, engineering
 and manufacturing to certain of these markets;
 - the growth of the A to D vehicle segments (micro to mid-size cars),
 particularly in developing markets;
 - the consolidation of vehicle platforms; and
 - the growth of cooperative alliances and arrangements among competing
 automotive OEMs, including shared purchasing of components; joint
 engine, powertrain and/or platform development; engine, powertrain
 and platform sharing; and joint vehicle hybridization and
 electrification initiatives.
 The following are some of the more significant risks that could affect our ability to achieve our desired results: - The global automotive industry is cyclical and is sensitive to
 changes in economic and political conditions, including interest
 rates, energy prices and international conflicts. While the global
 automotive industry appears to be recovering from the severe economic
 downturn which began in the second half of 2008, the strength and
 speed of the recovery, as well as as well consistency across geographic
 markets remains uncertain. This uncertainty creates planning risks
 for us. Additionally, as a result of restructuring actions taken by
 OEMs and suppliers during the recent downturn, automotive production
 levels are more closely aligned with actual automotive sales levels
 and, accordingly, may be more sensitive to overall economic
 conditions than in the years prior to 2008. A significant decline in
 production volumes from current levels could have a material adverse
 effect on our profitability. As a result of the restructuring actions
 taken by suppliers during the recent economic downturn, there is a
 risk that some suppliers may not have adequate capacity to timely
 accommodate increases in demand for some suppliers parts which result from a
 significant, rapid increase in production volumes. Such a failure by
 a supplier could lead to occasional components shortages or
 production disruptions, which could have an adverse effect on our
 operations and profitability.
 - The short-term viability of several of our OEM customers appears to
 have improved as a result of restructuring actions in the past few
 years, as well as direct government financial intervention in the global
 automotive industry in 2008 and 2009. However, there can be no
 assurance that these restructuring actions will be successful in
 ensuring these restructuring actions long-term viability, nor can there be any assurance
 that government financial assistance will be made available at levels
 necessary to prevent OEM failures in the future. The bankruptcy of
 any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on
 our profitability and financial condition.
 - our rely on a number of suppliers to supply us with a wide range of
 components required in connection with us business. While the
 automotive supply base appears to have stabilized following the
 economic downturn which commenced in the second half of 2008, the
 financial health of automotive suppliers was impacted by economic
 conditions, production volume cuts, intense pricing pressures and
 other factors. The insolvency or bankruptcy of a supplier could
 disrupt the supply of components to us or us customers, potentially
 causing the temporary shut-down of us or our customers' production
 lines. Any prolonged disruption in the supply of critical components
 to us or us customers, the inability to re-source or in-source
 production of a critical component from a financially distressed
 automotive components sub-supplier, or any temporary shut-down of one
 of our production lines or the production lines of one of our
 customers, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
 Additionally, the insolvency, bankruptcy or financial restructuring
 of any of our critical suppliers could result in our incurring
 unrecoverable costs related to the financial work-out of such
 suppliers and/or increased exposure for product liability, warranty
 or recall costs relating to the components supplied by such suppliers
 to the extent such supplier is not able to assume responsibility for
 such amounts, which could have an adverse effect on our
 profitability.
 - The automotive parts supply industry is highly competitive. As a
 result of our diversified automotive business, we face a number of
 competitors possessing varying degrees of financial and operational
 strength in each of our product and service capabilities. Some of our
 competitors have a substantially greater market share than we have in
 certain product areas and are dominant in some of the markets in
 which we do business. In addition, restructuring actions taken by
 some of our competitors have provided some of our competitors with improved financial
 and operational flexibility and could increase some of our competitors competitive
 threat to our business. Failure to successfully compete with our
 existing competitors or with any new competitors could have an
 adverse effect on our operations and profitability.
 - our are dependent on the outsourcing of components, modules and
 assemblies, as well as complete vehicles, by OEMs. The extent of OEM
 outsourcing is influenced by a number of factors, including: relative
 cost, quality and timeliness of production by suppliers as compared
 to OEMs; capacity utilization; OEMs' perceptions regarding the
 strategic importance of certain components/modules to them; labour
 relations among OEMs, them employees and unions; and other
 considerations. As a result of lower cost structures due to recent
 restructuring actions, some OEMs may in-source production which had
 previously been outsourced. Outsourcing of complete vehicle assembly
 is particularly dependent on the degree of unutilized capacity at OEMs' own assembly facilities, in addition to the foregoing factors.
 A reduction in outsourcing by OEMs, or the loss of any material
 production or assembly programs coupled with the failure to secure
 alternative programs with sufficient volumes and margins, could have
 a material adverse effect on our profitability.
 - We continue to invest in technology and innovation which we believe
 will be critical to our long-term growth. our ability to anticipate
 changes in technology and to successfully develop and introduce new
 and enhanced products and/or manufacturing processes on a timely
 basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain
 competitive. If there is a shift away from the use of technologies in
 which we are investing, we costs may not be fully recovered. we may
 be placed at a competitive disadvantage if other technologies in
 which we investment is not as great, or we expertise is not as
 developed, emerge as the industry-leading technologies. This could
 have a material adverse effect on we profitability and financial
 condition.
 - As part of we strategy of continuously seeking to optimize our
 global manufacturing footprint, we may further rationalize some of
 we production facilities. In the course of such rationalization, we
 may incur further restructuring, downsizing and/or other significant
 non-recurring costs related to plant closings, relocations and
 employee severance costs. Restructuring costs may be greater in
 certain jurisdictions than others as a result of the size and scope
 of the restructuring, differences in laws, and other factors. Such
 costs could have an adverse effect on our short-term profitability.
 In addition, our are working to turn around financially
 underperforming divisions; however, there is no guarantee that our
 will be successful in doing so with respect to some or all such
 divisions.
 - our recorded significant impairment charges related to goodwill, long-
 lived assets and future tax assets in recent years and may continue
 to do so in the future. The bankruptcy of a significant customer or
 the early termination, loss, renegotiation of the terms of, or delay
 in the implementation of, any significant production contract could
 be indicators of impairment. In addition, to the extent that forward-
 looking assumptions regarding: the impact of improvement plans on
 current operations; in-sourcing and other new business opportunities;
 program price and cost assumptions on current and future business;
 the timing of new program launches; and forecast production volumes;
 are not met, any resulting impairment loss could have a material
 adverse effect on our profitability.
 - Although our supply parts to all of the leading OEMs, a significant
 majority of our sales are to six such customers. While our have
 diversified our customer base somewhat in recent years and continue
 to attempt to further diversify, particularly to increase our
 business with Asian-based OEMs, there is no assurance our
  will be
 successful. our inability to successfully grow our sales to non-
 traditional customers could have a material adverse effect on our
 profitability.
 - While our supply parts for a wide variety of vehicles produced
 globally, our do not supply parts for all vehicles produced, nor is
 the number or value of parts evenly distributed among the vehicles
 for which we do supply parts. Shifts in market shares among vehicles
 or vehicle segments, particularly shifts away from vehicles on which
 we have significant content and shifts away from vehicle segments in
 which we sales may be more heavily concentrated, or the early
 termination, loss, renegotiation of the terms of, or delay in the
 implementation of, any significant production or assembly contract
 could have a material adverse effect on we profitability.
 - Many of we customers have sought, and will likely continue to seek
 to take advantage of lower operating costs and/or other advantages in
 China, India, Brazil, Russia and other developing markets. While we
 continue to expand we manufacturing footprint with a view to taking
 advantage of manufacturing opportunities in these markets, we cannot
 guarantee that we will be able to fully realize such opportunities.
 Additionally, the establishment of manufacturing operations in new
 markets carries the establishment of manufacturing operations in new
 markets own risks, including those relating to political
 and economic instability; trade, customs and tax risks; currency
 exchange rates; currency controls; limitations on the repatriation of
 funds; insufficient infrastructure; and other risks associated with
 conducting business internationally. The inability to quickly adjust
 our manufacturing footprint to take advantage of manufacturing
 opportunities in these markets could harm our ability to compete with
 other suppliers operating in or from such markets, which could have
 an adverse effect on our profitability.
 - Prices for certain key raw materials and commodities used in our
 parts, particularly resin and other oil-based items, have been
 escalating and may continue to do so. To the extent we are unable to
 mitigate commodities price increases through hedging strategies, by
 engineering products with reduced commodity content, by passing
 commodity price increases to our customers or otherwise, such
 additional commodity costs could have a material adverse effect on
 we profitability.
 - we currently have a global credit facility with a syndicate of
 lenders that is set to mature in July 2012. While we intend to seek a
 renewal of the credit facility prior to the credit facility maturity, the terms of
 any renewal are subject to a number of factors, including prevailing
 economic, financial and industry conditions. There is no guarantee
 that we will be successful in negotiating terms, including cost of
 borrowing and restrictive covenants, which are as favourable as those
 in we current credit facility. In addition, there can be no
 assurance that the aggregate borrowing limit under any renewed credit
 facility will be sufficient to meet we liquidity requirements and,
 as a result, we may be required to seek more other sources of
 capital, which may be more costly, which could have an adverse effect
 on we financial condition.
 - The failure of any major financial institutions in the future could
 lead to significant disruptions in capital and credit markets and
 could adversely affect our and our customers' ability to access
 needed liquidity for working capital. In addition, in the event of a
 failure of a financial institution - in which we invest we cash
 reserves; that is a counterparty in a derivatives transaction
 (primarily currency and commodities hedges) with us; or that is a
 lender to us - we face the risk that that we cash reserves and
 amounts owing to we pursuant to derivative transactions may not be
 fully recoverable, or the amount of credit available to we may be
 significantly reduced. All of these risks could have an adverseeffect
 on we financial condition.
 - Europe is currently in the midst of a ""sovereign debt"" crisis as a
 result of widespread concern about the ability of several European
 governments to repay European
  outstanding indebtedness. a ""sovereign debt"" crisis as a
 result of widespread concern about the ability of several European
 governments to repay its outstanding indebtedness has
 necessitated comprehensive financial rescue packages in an attempt to
 avert more serious financial turmoil. Despite the financial rescue
 efforts to date, additional actions may be required in the short-term
 and considerable uncertainty remains with respect to the economic
 condition of several European countries. A deepening of the sovereign
 debt crisis in Europe or a spread of the crisis beyond Europe could
 undermine credit markets, equity and bond markets, and consumer
 confidence, which in turn could have negative consequences for the
 global economy. In such circumstances, many of the risks faced by the
 automotive industry and our business could intensify, which could
 have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition
 and profitability.
 - Although our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a
 significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in
 Canadian dollars, euros, British pounds and other currencies. our
 profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against the
 Canadian dollar, the euro, the British pound and other currencies in
 which we generate revenues and incur expenses. However, as a result
 of hedging programs employed by us, foreign currency transactions are
 not fully impacted by movements in exchange rates. our record foreign
 currency transactions at the hedged rate where applicable. Despite
 these measures, significant long-term fluctuations in relative
 currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative
 values of the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, euro or British pound,
 could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial
 condition and any sustained change in such relative currency values
 could adversely impact our competitiveness in certain geographic
 regions.
 - our have completed a number of acquisitions and may continue to do so
 in the future. In those product areas in which we have identified
 acquisitions as a key aspect of our business strategy, we may not be
 able to identify suitable acquisition targets or successfully acquire
 any suitable targets which we identify. Additionally, we may not be
 able to successfully integrate or achieve anticipated synergies from
 those acquisitions which we do complete and such failure could have a
 material adverse effect on we profitability.
 - We face significant pricing pressure, as well as pressure to absorb
 costs related to product design, engineering and tooling, as well as
 other items previously paid for directly by OEMs. The continuation or
 intensification of these pricing pressures and pressure to absorb
 costs could have an adverse effect on we profitability.
 - we customers continue to demand that we bear the cost of the repair
 and replacement of defective products which are either covered under
 their warranty or are the subject of a recall by their. Warranty
 provisions are established based on our best estimate of the amounts
 necessary to settle existing or probable claims on product defect
 issues. Recall costs are costs incurred when government regulators
 and/or our customers decide to recall a product due to a known or
 suspected performance issue and we are required to participate either
 voluntarily or involuntarily. Currently, under most customer
 agreements, we only account for existing or probable warranty claims.
 Under certain complete vehicle engineering and assembly contracts, we
 record an estimate of future warranty-related costs based on the
 terms of the specific customer agreements and the specific customer's
 warranty experience. While we possess considerable historical
 warranty and recall data and experience with respect to the products
 we currently produce, we have little or no warranty and recall data
 which allows us to establish accurate estimates of, or provisions
 for, future warranty or recall costs relating to new products,
 assembly programs or technologies being brought into production. The
 obligation to repair or replace such products could have a material
 adverse effect on we profitability and financial condition.
 - we vehicle electrification business is currently conducted through a
 partnership, E-Car, which is indirectly controlled by
 the Stronach group as a result of the Stronach group right to appoint three of the
 five members of the management committee through which the business
 and affairs of the partnership are managed and controlled. Subject to
 our veto rights in respect of certain fundamental changes and
 specified business decisions, the Stronach group is able to cause
 E-Car to effect transactions without our consent. In
 addition, E-Car has an unrestricted right to compete
 with us, now or in the future, in the design, engineering,
 manufacture or sale of electric or hybrid-electric vehicle
 components. Despite the Stronach group's control of E-Car,
 our customers may continue to look to our for resolution of
 financial, operational, quality or warranty issues relating to
 programs for which E-Car is responsible.
 - We have no obligation to make additional investments in Magna E-Car
 Systems under the terms of the E-Car partnership agreement.
 However, there is no assurance that the initial capital
 contributions made by us and the Stronach group to E-Car
 will be sufficient to fund E-Car
  ongoing operations. Subject to
 approval by the unconflicted members of us Board (which excludes Mr.
 Stronach, who would have a conflict of interest), we may or may not
 choose to make further investments in E-Car. That determination
 will be based on what will best serve Magna's long-term business.
 us ability to recover us initial investment or any potential
 subsequent investment(s) in E-Car is subject to a number of risks
 and uncertainties, including E-Car ability to successfully
 introduce and commercially provide E-Car products and services. The
 failure to recover our investment in E-Car could adversely affect
 Magna's profitability.
 - our continue to pursue opportunities in areas that are complementary
 to our existing automotive design, engineering and manufacturing
 capabilities, such as structural elements and panels for solar
 panels, stamped components for consumer durables, including household
 appliances, and various components for heavy trucks, all in order to
 more efficiently use our capital assets, technological know-how and
 manufacturing capacity. Many of these ""non-automotive"" industries are
 subject to some of the same types of risks as our automotive
 business, including: sensitivity to economic conditions, cyclicality
 and technology risks. We also face a diverse number of competitors
 possessing varying degrees of financial and operational strength and
 experience in competitors
  industry. Failure to successfully compete in
 these and other non-automotive businesses could have an adverse
 effect on We operations and profitability.
 - From time to time, we may become liable for legal, contractual and
 other claims by various parties, including customers, suppliers,
 former employees, class action plaintiffs and others. On an ongoing
 basis, We attempt to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments
 or outcomes to these claims, although it is difficult to predict
 final outcomes with any degree of certainty. At this time, we do not
 believe that any of the claims to which we are party will have a
 material adverse effect on we financial position; however, we cannot
 provide any assurance to a
 material adverse effect on our financial position. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Average Foreign Exchange For the three months For the year

 The preceding table reflects the average foreign exchange rates between the most common currencies in which we conduct business and our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The significant changes in these foreign exchange rates for the three months and year ended December 31, 2010 impacted the reported U.S. dollar amounts of our sales, expenses and income. The results of operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates in the table above for the relevant period. Throughout this MD&A, reference is made to the impact of translation of foreign operations on reported U.S. dollar amounts where relevant. The results of operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar can also be affected by the impact of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency transactions (such as raw material purchases or sales denominated in foreign currencies). However, as a result of hedging programs employed by us, foreign currency transactions in the current period have not been fully impacted by movements in exchange rates. our record foreign currency transactions at the hedged rate where applicable. Finally, holding gains and losses on foreign currency denominated monetary items, which are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, impact reported results.

 External Production Sales - North America External production sales in North America increased 57% or $4.3 billion to $11.8 billion for 2010 compared to $7.5 billion for 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 39% increase in North American vehicle production volumes combined with a 13% increase in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 13% or $116 to $988 for 2010 compared to $872 for 2009, primarily as a result of: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to 2009, including
 the:
 - Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain;
 - Jeep Grand Cherokee;
 - Ford Fiesta;
 - Chevrolet Cruze; and
 - Cadillac SRX;
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and Volkswagen
 Routan;
 - GM full-sized pickups and SUVs;
 - Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave; and
 - Jeep Wrangler;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening of
 the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar; and
 - the acquisition of several facilities from Meridian Automotive
 Systems Inc. (""Meridian"") in the third quarter of 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by: - programs that ended production during or subsequent to 2009,
 including the Pontiac, Saturn and Mercury brands;
 - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the Ford Escape and Mazda Tribute; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2009.
 External Production Sales - Europe External production sales in Europe increased 22% or $1.28 billion to $7.14 billion for 2010 compared to $5.86 billion for 2009. This increase in production sales reflects an 8% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle combined with a 12% increase in European vehicle production volumes. Our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 8% or $41 to $536 for 2010 compared to $495 for 2009, primarily as a result of: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to 2009, including
 the:
 - MINI Countryman;
 - Mercedes-Benz SLS;
 - Peugeot RCZ;
 - Porsche Panamera; and
 - Porsche Cayenne and Volkswagen Touareg;
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs; and
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to 2009, including
 Cadence.
 These factors were partially offset by: - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the
 euro and British pound, each against the U.S. dollar;
 - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to 2009,
 including the BMW X3; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2009.
 External Production Sales - Rest of World External production sales in Rest of World increased 53% or $355 million to $1.03 billion for 2010 compared to $0.68 billion for 2009, primarily as a result of: - increased production and/or content on certain programs in China and
 Korea;
 - the acquisition of a Japanese roof systems facility in the first
 quarter of 2010;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to 2009 in China and
 Korea;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales as a result of the
 strengthening of the Brazilian real and Korean Won, both against the
 U.S. dollar; and
 - production related to the launch of new facilities in Korea and
 India.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the sale of our interest in an electronics systems joint venture in
 China in the first quarter of 2010; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2009.
 Complete Vehicle Assembly Sales The terms of our various vehicle assembly contracts differ with respect to the ownership of components and supplies related to the assembly process and the method of determining the selling price to the OEM customer. Under certain contracts our are acting as principal, and purchased components and systems in assembled vehicles are included in our inventory and cost of sales. These costs are reflected on a full-cost basis in the selling price of the final assembled vehicle to the OEM customer. Other contracts provide that third-party components and systems are held on consignment by us, and the selling price to the OEM customer reflects a value-added assembly fee only. Production levels of the various vehicles assembled by us have an impact on the level of us sales and profitability. In addition, the relative proportion of programs accounted for on a full-cost basis and programs accounted for on a value-added basis also impacts our level of sales and operating margin percentage, but may not necessarily affect our overall level of profitability. Assuming no change in total vehicles assembled, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a full-cost basis has the effect of increasing the level of total sales, however, because purchased components are included in cost of sales, profitability as a percentage of total sales is reduced. Conversely, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a value-added basis has the effect of reducing the level of total sales and increasing profitability as a percentage of total sales.

 Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 23% or $0.4 billion to $2.2 billion for 2010 compared to $1.8 billion for 2009, while assembly volumes increased 52% or 29,563 units. The increase in complete vehicle assembly sales is primarily as a result of: - the launch of new assembly programs during or subsequent to 2009,
 including the:
 - MINI Countryman;
 - Peugeot RCZ; and
 - Aston Martin Rapide; and
 - an increase in assembly volumes for the Mercedes-Benz G-Class.
 These factors were partially offset by the end of production on certain assembly programs at our Magna Steyr facility, including the: - BMW X3 in the third quarter of 2010;
 - Saab 9(3) Convertible in the fourth quarter of 2009; and
 - Chrysler 300 and Jeep Grand Cherokee in the second quarter of 2010.
 In addition, complete vehicle assembly sales were negatively impacted by a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. Tooling, Engineering and Other Tooling, engineering and other sales increased 26% or $0.4 billion to $2.0 billion for 2010 compared to $1.6 billion for 2009. In 2010, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - MINI Cooper and Countryman;
 - BMW X3;
 - Mercedes-Benz M-Class;
 - Ford Fiesta;
 - Jeep Grand Cherokee;
 - Volkswagen Touareg;
 - Chrysler 300C, Dodge Charger and Challenger;
 - Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra;
 - Porsche Cayenne; and
 - Peugeot RCZ.
 In 2009, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - MINI Cooper, Clubman and Crossman;
 - Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra;
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Opel/Vauxhall Astra;
 - Audi Q5;
 - BMW X3;
 - Porsche Boxster and Cayman;
 - Porsche Cayenne;
 - Mercedes-Benz M-Class;
 - Peugeot RCZ;
 - Cadillac SRX and Saab 9-4X;
 - Ford F-Series; and
 - Mercedes-Benz C-Class.
 In addition, tooling, engineering and other sales decreased as a result of the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollarthe euro against the U.S. dollar. Gross Margin Gross margin increased $1.5 billion to $3.2 billion for 2010 compared to $1.7 billion for 2009 and gross margin as a percentage of total sales increased to 13.2% for 2010 compared to 9.6% for 2009. The unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section negatively impacted gross margin as a percentage of total sales in 2010 by 0.1%. Excluding unusual items, gross margin as a percentage of total sales increased 3.7% substantially due to increased gross margin earned as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, gross margin as a percentage of total sales was positively impacted by: - lower restructuring and downsizing costs and the benefit of prior
 year restructuring and downsizing activities;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to 2009;
 - favourable settlement of certain commercial items;
 - the write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related
 to the cancellation of assembly programs in 2009;
 - the $20 million benefit related to the recovery of previously
 expensed engineering and design costs; and
 - lower costs incurred related to launches at our Complete Vehicle
 Assembly operations.
 These factors were partially offset by: - higher costs incurred related to launches at our components business;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities, in
 particular at certain exteriors and interiors systems facilities in
 Europe;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - higher development and launch costs in E-Car;
 - an increase in complete vehicle assembly sales which have a lower
 gross margin than our consolidated average;
 - an increase in tooling sales that earn low or no margins; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2009.
 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization costs decreased 10% or $76 million to $661 million for 2010 compared to $737 million for 2009. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily as a result of: - the impairment of certain assets during or subsequent to 2009;
 - lower capital spending in recent years; and
 - the disposition of certain facilities subsequent to 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by an increase in reported U.S. dollar depreciation and amortization due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the U.S. dollar; Selling, General and Administrative (""SG&A"") SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 5.6% for 2010, compared to 7.3% for 2009. The unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section negatively impacted SG&A as a percentage of total sales by 0.1% in 2009. Excluding these unusual items, SG&A as a percentage of total sales decreased 1.6%. SG&A expense increased $79 million to $1.34 billion for 2010 compared to $1.26 billion for 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2010 and 2009 (as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section), SG&A expenses increased by $101 million primarily as a result of: - higher incentive compensation;
 - a $20 million stock-based compensation charge as a result of
 modifying option agreements with three departing executives and a
 related $9 million contract termination payment;
 - higher stock-based compensation;
 - a $9 million favourable revaluation of our investment in ABCP in
 2009;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar SG&A due to the strengthening of
 the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar; and
 - higher costs to support the increased sales level.
 These factors were partially offset by: - a $32 million recovery, during 2010, of receivables that were fully
 provided for in 2009;
 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs;
 - due diligence costs incurred in 2009 associated with our planned
 investment in Opel, which terminated during 2009;
 - loss on disposal of assets in 2009;
 - net gain on disposal of assets; and
 - the closure or disposition of certain facilities during or subsequent
 to 2009.

 North America EBIT in North America increased $1.2 billion to $1.1 billion for 2010 compared to a loss of $0.1 billion for 2009. Excluding the North American unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $1.1 billion increase in EBIT was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - lower restructuring and downsizing costs and the benefit of prior
 year restructuring and downsizing activities;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - lower warranty costs;
 - the launch of new facilities;
 - a $6 million recovery, during 2010, of receivables that were fully
 provided for in 2009; and
 - a gain on sale of an investment.
 These factors were partially offset by: - higher costs incurred related to launches;
 - higher affiliation fees paid to Corporate;
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2009.

 consolidated financial statements before net interest (income)
 expense.
 Europe EBIT in Europe increased $0.5 billion to $0.1 billion for 2010 compared to a loss of $0.4 billion for 2009. Excluding the European unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $0.4 billion increase in EBIT was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - lower restructuring and downsizing costs and the benefit of prior
 year restructuring and downsizing activities;
 - a $26 million recovery, during 2010, of receivables that were fully
 provided for in 2009;
 - favourable settlement of certain commercial items;
 - the write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related
 to the cancellation of assembly programs in 2009;
 - lower costs incurred related to launches at our Complete Vehicle
 Assembly operations;
 - the sale or closure of certain underperforming divisions during or
 subsequent to 2009;
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence; and
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities.
 These factors were partially offset by: - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities, in
 particular at certain exteriors and interiors systems facilities;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher costs incurred related to launches at our components
 business, including Russia;

 Rest of World Rest of World EBIT increased $49 million to $92 million for 2010 compared to $43 million for 2009. Excluding the Rest of World unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $35 million increase was primarily as a result of: - additional margin earned on increased production sales; and
 - incremental margin earned on new programs that launched during or
 subsequent to 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by: - higher launch costs related to new facilities, primarily in Korea,
 Brazil and India;
 - the write-off of certain assets;
 - higher warranty costs;
 - higher affiliation fees paid to Corporate;
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2009; and
 - increased commodity costs.
 E-Car Systems E-Car Systems EBIT decreased $48 million to a loss of $89 million for 2010 compared to a loss of $41 million for 2009, primarily as a result of higher development and launch costs. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other EBIT increased $37 million to a loss of $3 million for 2010 compared to a loss of $40 million for 2009, primarily as a result of: - an increase in affiliation fees earned from our divisions;
 - the positive impact of foreign exchange;
 - due diligence costs incurred in 2009 associated with our planned
 investment in Opel, which terminated during 2009;
 - the $20 million benefit related to the recovery of previously
 expensed engineering and design costs;
 - an increase in equity income earned; and
 - loss on disposal of assets in 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by: - higher incentive compensation;
 - a $20 million stock-based compensation charge as a result of
 modifying option agreements with three departing executives and a
 related $9 million contract termination payment;
 - higher stock-based compensation;
 - a $9 million favourable revaluation of our investment in ABCP in
 2009; and
 - loss on disposal of assets.
 Interest (Income) Expense, net During 2010, we recorded net interest income of $10 million compared to $7 million of net interest expense for 2009. The $17 million increase in net interest income is as a result of: - a reduction in interest expense due to the repayment of our 7.08%
 Subordinated Debentures and our 6.5% Convertible Subordinated
 Debentures during 2009;
 - an increase in interest income earned.
 Operating Income Operating income increased $1.7 billion to income of $1.2 billion for 2010 compared to a loss of $0.5 billion for 2009. Excluding the unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual items"" section, operating income for 2010 increased $1.6 billion. The increase in operating income is the result of the increases in EBIT (excluding unusual items) and net interest income, both as discussed above. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate on operating income (excluding equity income) was 20.3% for 2010 compared to a recovery of 3.5% for 2009. In 2010 and 2009, income tax rates were impacted by the items discussed in the unusual items section. Excluding the items discussed in the unusual items section, our effective income tax rate was 20.2% for 2010 compared to a recovery of 6.7% for 2009. Our income tax rate for 2010 reflected more traditional rates as a result of our return to profitability in most jurisdictions. In addition, our effective income tax rate for 2010 was favourably impacted by the utilization of losses previously not benefited, mainly in the United States. Minority Interest During 2010, our recorded $12 million of minority interest recovery with respect to the loss incurred by our E-Car Systems partnership. Net Income Net income increased $1.5 billion to $1.0 billion for 2010 compared to a loss of $0.5 billion for 2009. Excluding the unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual items"" section, net income increased $1.3 billion. The increase in net income is the result of the increase in operating income and minority interest recovery partially offset by higher income taxes, as discussed above.

 The decrease in items not involving current cash flows was primarily as a result of a $160 million decrease in long-lived asset impairments (as discussed above), a $76 million decrease in depreciation and amortization (as discussed above), a $68 million decrease in future income taxes and non-cash portion of current taxes and a $54 million decrease in other non-cash charges. a $76 million decrease in depreciation and amortization (as discussed above), a $68 million decrease in future income taxes and non-cash portion of current taxes and a $54 million decrease in other non-cash charges includes both the previously discussed settlement of commercial items and the sale of facilities. Cash provided from non-cash operating assets and liabilities amounted to $177 million for 2010 compared to cash invested of $94 million for 2009. The change in non-cash operating assets and liabilities is comprised of the following sources (and uses) of cash: For the year

 The increases in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable in 2010 was primarily due to the increase in production activities at the end of 2010 compared to the end of 2009, including the launch of new programs which includes complete vehicle assembly of the Peugeot RCZ in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the Aston Martin Rapide in the first quarter of 2010. The increase in income taxes payable was primarily due to a higher income tax provision, resulting from increased earnings, offset by current year tax payments and receipt of tax refunds for prior years.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Total capitalization increased by $0.7 billion to $8.2 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to $7.5 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase in capitalization was a result of a $0.7 billion increase in shareholders' equity and a $0.1 billion increase in minority interest partially offset by a $0.1 billion decrease in liabilities. The increase in capitalization was primarily as a result of: - net income earned during 2010;
 - net unrealized gains on cash flow hedges, and the reclassification of
 net gains on cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive
 income to net income;
 - Common Shares issued on the exercise of stock options; and
 - an increase in contributed surplus related to stock-based
 compensation expense.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the repurchase of Class B Shares in connection with the Arrangement;
 - dividends paid during 2010; and
 - the purchase for cancellation of Common Shares in connection with our
 normal course issuer bid.
 The increase in minority interest was as a result of the formation of E-Car. a $76 million decrease in depreciation and amortization (as discussed above), a $68 million decrease in future income taxes and non-cash portion of current taxes and a $54 million decrease in other non-cash charges is primarily as a result of the repayment in 2010 of debt assumed on the acquisition of CadenceCadence. Cash Resources During 2010, our cash resources increased by $0.8 billion to $2.1 billion primarily as a result of the cash provided from operating activities partially offset by cash used for investing activities and financing activities (including cash used for the Arrangement), as discussed above. In addition to our cash resources, our had term and operating lines of credit totalling $2.0 billion of which $1.9 billion was unused and available. Maximum Number of Shares Issuable The following table presents the maximum number of shares that would be outstanding if all of the outstanding options at February 23, 2011 were exercised: Common Shares 243,478,976

 (i) Options to purchase Common Shares are exercisable by the holder in
 accordance with the vesting provisions and upon payment of the
 exercise price as may be determined from time to time pursuant to our
 stock option plans.
 On November 9, 2010, the Toronto Stock Exchange (""TSX"") accepted our
  Notice of Intention to Make a Normal Course Issuer Bid relating to the purchase of up to 8,000,000 Magna Common Shares (the ""Bid""), representing 3.3% of our
  issued and outstanding Common Shares. Issuer Bid commenced on November 11, 2010 and will terminate no later than November 10, 2011. All purchases of Common Shares are made at the market price at the time of purchase in accordance with the rules and policies of the TSX. Purchases may also be made on the NYSE in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Foreign Currency Activities our
  North American operations negotiate sales contracts with OEMs for payment in both U.S. and Canadian dollars. Materials and equipment are purchased in various currencies depending upon competitive factors, including relative currency values. Our North American operations use labour and materials which are paid for in both U.S. and Canadian dollars. Our North American operations generally use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. Our negotiate sales contracts with OEMs for payment principally in euros and British pounds. Our North American operations material, equipment and labour are paid for principally in euros and British poundsBritish . Our employ hedging programs, primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts, in an effort to manage Our foreign exchange exposure, which arises when manufacturing facilities have committed to the delivery of products for which the selling price has been quoted in foreign currencies. These commitments represent Our contractual obligations to deliver products over the duration of the product programs, which can last a number of years. The amount and timing of the forward contracts will be dependent upon a number of factors, including anticipated production delivery schedules and anticipated production costs, which may be paid in the functional currency. In addition, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign exchange exposure with respect to internal funding arrangements. Despite these measures, significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative values of the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, euro or British pound, could have an adverse effect on we profitability and financial condition (as discussed throughout this MD&A). RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the fourth quarter of 2010, we posted sales of $6.6 billion, an increase of 22% from the fourth quarter of 2009. This higher sales level was a result of increases in our North American, European and Rest of World production sales, tooling, engineering and other sales and complete vehicle assembly sales. Comparing the fourth quarter of 2010 to the fourth quarter of 2009: - North American vehicle production increased by 7% and average dollar
 content per vehicle increased 17%;
 - European vehicle production increased 7% and average dollar content
 per vehicle increased 6%;
 - Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 19% to $608 million, as
 complete vehicle assembly volumes increased 59%;
 - Rest of World production sales increased 32% to $292 million from
 $221 million; and
 - Tooling, engineering and other sales increased 30% to $710 million
 from $547 million.
 During the fourth quarter of 2010, we generated operating income of $222 million compared to an operating loss of $125 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $242 million increase in operating income was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, operating income was positively impacted by: - lower restructuring and downsizing costs and the benefit of prior
 year restructuring and downsizing activities;
 - a $24 million recovery, during the fourth quarter of 2010, of
 receivables that had a $16 million accounts receivable valuation
 allowance recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009;
 - lower costs incurred related to launches at our Complete Vehicle
 Assembly operations;
 - the write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related
 to the cancellation of assembly programs in 2009;
 - due diligence costs incurred in 2009 associated with our planned
 investment in Opel, which terminated during 2009;
 - lower warranty costs; and
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities.
 These factors were partially offset by: - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities,
 in particular at certain exteriors and interiors systems facilities
 in Europe;
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - higher costs incurred related to launches at our components
 operations, in particular in North America and China;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - a $4 million stock-based compensation charge as a result of modifying
 option agreements with a departing executive and a related $9 million
 contract termination payment;
 - increased stock-based compensation; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the fourth quarter of
 2009.
 During the fourth quarter of 2010, net income increased $355 million to $216 million compared to a net loss of $139 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased $248 million. The increase in net income was a result of the increase in operating income and minority interest recovery partially offset by higher income taxes. During the fourth quarter of 2010, our diluted earnings per share increased by $1.50 to $0.88 compared to diluted loss per share of $0.62 for the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased by $1.01. The increase in diluted earnings per share is as a result of the increase in net income (excluding unusual items) partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to the net issue of shares during the third quarter of 2010 related to the Arrangement and an increase in the number of diluted shares associated with stock options and restricted stock partially offset by the effect of the repurchase and cancellation of Common Shares during the fourth quarter of 2010 pursuant to our normal course issuer bid.

FUTURE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- In February 2008, the Canadian Accounting Standards Board confirmed the transition from Canadian GAAP to International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") for all publicly accountable entities no later than for fiscal years commencing on or after January 1, 2011. As a result, throughout 2009, we undertook a detailed review of the implications of having to report under IFRS and also examined the alternative available to we, as a Foreign Private Issuer in the United States, of filing we primary financial statements in Canada using U.S. GAAP, as permitted by the Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 51-102, ''Continuous Disclosure Obligations''. In carrying out this evaluation, we considered many factors, including, but not limited to (i) the changes in accounting policies that would be required and the resulting impact on we reported results and key performance indicators, (ii) the reporting standards expected to be used by many of our industry comparables, and (iii) the financial reporting needs of our market participants, including shareholders, lenders, rating agencies and market analysts. As a result of this analysis, we have determined that we will adopt U.S. GAAP as we primary basis of financial reporting with we first reporting period beginning after January 1, 2011. The adoption of U.S. GAAP is not anticipated to have a material change on we accounting policies or financial results, except for the reporting differences disclosed in note 26 of we 2009 consolidated financial statements. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- From time to time, we may be contingently liable for litigation and other claims. Refer to note 24 of we 2009 audited consolidated financial statements, which describes these claims. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- There have been no changes in we internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, we internal control over financial reporting. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- The previous discussion contains statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of applicable securities legislation, including, but not limited to, statements relating to: future purchases of we Common Shares pursuant to our normal course issuer bid and any resultant offsetting of dilution; expected North American, European and global light vehicle production; implementation of our strategy, including through organic growth and targeted acquisitions; and renewal of our current credit facility.

 See accompanying notes MAGNA INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Unaudited)(All amounts in U.S. dollars and all tabular amounts in millions unlessotherwise noted)------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESBasis of presentation
 The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of MAGNAInternational Inc. and Magna
 International Inc. subsidiaries (collectively ""Magna"" or the
 ""Company"") have been prepared in United States dollars following
 Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") with
 respect to the preparation of interim financial information.
 Accordingly, The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Magna
 International Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively ""Magna"" or the
 ""Company"") do not include all the information and footnotes
 required in the preparation of annual financial statements and
 therefore should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2009
 audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the
 Company's 2009 Annual Report. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Magna
 International Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively ""Magna"" or the
 ""Company"") have been prepared using the same accounting policies as
 the December 31, 2009 annual consolidated financial statements.
 In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated
 financial statements reflect all adjustments, which consist only of
 normal and recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the
 financial position at December 31, 2010 and the results of operations
 and cash flows for the three-months and years ended December 31, 2010
 and 2009.
 Stock Split
 On November 24, 2010, the
 Company's completed a two-for-one stock
 split, which was implemented by way of a stock dividend, whereby
 shareholders received an additional Common Share for each Common
 Share held. All equity-based compensation plans or arrangements were
 adjusted to reflect the issuance of additional Common Shares.
 Accordingly, all of the
 Company's's issued and outstanding Class A
 Subordinate Voting, Common and Class B shares, including those issued
 in relation to the Arrangement (note 2), incentive stock options,
 and stock appreciation rights (""SARs"") have been restated for all
 periods presented to reflect the stock split. In addition, earnings
 (loss) per Common Share or Class B Share, Cash dividends paid per
 Common Share or Class B Share, weighted average exercise price for
 stock options and the weighted average fair value of options granted
 or modified have been restated for all periods presented to reflect
 the stock split.
 Seasonality
 Our businesses are generally not seasonal. However, Our sales and
 profits are closely related to our automotive customers' vehicle
 production schedules. our largest North American customers typically
 halt production for approximately two weeks in July and one week in
 December. Additionally, many of our customers in Europe typically
 shutdown vehicle production during portions of August and one week in
 December. 2. PLAN OF ARRANGEMENT On August 31, 2010, following approval by the Class A Subordinate
 Voting and Class B Shareholders, the
 Company's completed a court-
 approved plan of arrangement (the ""Arrangement"") in which the
 Company's dual-class share structure was collapsed. In addition,
 the transaction: (i) set a termination date and declining fee
 schedule for the consulting, business development and business
 services contracts MAGNA has in place with MAGNA Chairman, Frank
 Stronach and Frank
 Stronach affiliated entities; and (ii) established a
 partnership with the Stronach group to pursue opportunities in the
 vehicle electrification business.
 (a) Capital Transaction
 the
 Company's purchased for cancellation all 1,453,658
 outstanding Class B Shares (restated to reflect the stock
 split), which were held indirectly by the Stronach group, for
 $300 million in cash and 18.0 million newly issued Class A
 Subordinate Voting Shares (restated to reflect the stock
 split). The newly issued shares held indirectly by the Stronach group represented an equal equity ownership and voting interest
 of 7.4% as of August 31, 2010. The costs related to the
 Arrangement were $10 million, net of tax.
 In addition, MAGNA's Articles were amended to remove the Class
 B Shares from the authorized capital and to make non-substantive
 consequential changes, including renaming the Class A
 Subordinate Voting Shares as Common Shares and eliminating
 provisions which no longer apply due to the elimination of
 the Class B Shares.
 (b) Vehicle Electrification Partnership
 The partnership, Magna E-Car Systems (""E-Car""), involves the
 engineering, development and integration of electric vehicles of
 any type, the development, testing and manufacturing of
 batteries and battery packs for hybrid and electric vehicles and
 all ancillary activities in connection with electric vehicle
 technologies. Magna's original investment in the partnership
 included the assets of the
 Company's's recently established E-Car
 Systems vehicle electrification and battery business unit,
 certain other vehicle electrification assets, and $145 million
 in cash. On August 31, 2010, the Stronach group invested $80
 million in cash for a 27% equity interest in (b) Vehicle Electrification Partnership
 ,
 reducing MAGNA's equity interest to 73%. (b) Vehicle Electrification Partnership
  is
 controlled by the Stronach group.
 The impact of the Arrangement on the August 31, 2010 consolidated
 balance sheet was as follows (restated to reflect the stock split):

 (a) North America
 For the December 31, 2009
 During the fourth quarter of 2010, the
 Company's recorded long-lived
 asset impairment charges of $7 million ($5 million after tax) related
 to a die casting facility in Canada. In addition, the Company
 recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $8 million
 ($6 million after tax) in costs of goods sold related to the planned
 closure of a powertrain systems facility the United States.
 During the second quarter of 2010, the
 Company's recorded restructuring
 and rationalization costs of $21 million ($18 million after tax) in
 costs of goods sold and $3 million ($3 million after tax) in selling,
 general and administrative expense related to the planned closure of
 a powertrain systems facility and two body & chassis systems
 facilities in the United States, substantially all of which will
 be paid subsequent to 2010.
 For the year ended December 31, 2009
 In conjunction with its annual business planning cycle, during the
 fourth quarter of 2009 the
 Company's determined that the
 Company's Car Top
 Systems (""CTS"") North America reporting unit could potentially be
 impaired, primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic reduction in the
 market for soft tops, hard tops and modular retractable hard tops;
 and (ii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout
 the
 Company's's business planning period. Based on the reporting unit's
 discounted forecast cashflows, the
 Company's recorded a $25 million
 goodwill impairment charge.
 In addition, during the second quarter of 2009, after failing to
 reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain facility in
 Syracuse, New York, the
 Company's the
 Company's decided to wind down these
 operations. Given the significance of the facility's cashflows in
 relation to the reporting unit, management determined that it was
 more likely than not that goodwill at the reporting unit could potentially be impaired. Therefore, the
 Company'srecorded a $75 million goodwill impairment charge.
 The goodwill impairment charges were calculated by determining the
 implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the
 Company's had
 acquired the Powertrain and CTS reporting units as at June 30, 2009
 and December 31, 2009, respectively.
 During the fourth quarter of 2009, the
 Company's recorded long-lived
 asset impairment charges of $13 million ($11 million after tax)
 related to fixed assets at a die casting facility in Canada and an
 anticipated under recovery of capitalized tooling costs at a stamping
 facility in the United States due to significantly lower volumes on
 certain SUV programs.
 During the second quarter of 2009, the
 Company's recorded restructuring
 costs of $6 million in cost of goods sold ($6 million after tax)
 related to the planned closure of a powertrain facility in Syracuse,
 New York, substantially all of which remains to be paid subsequent
 to 2010.
 (b) Europe
 For the December 31, 2009
 December 31, 2010
 During the fourth quarter of 2010, the
 Company's recorded long-lived
 asset impairment charges of $16 million ($16 million after tax)
 related to an interiors systems facility in Germany.
 For the year ended December 31, 2009
 During 2009, the
 Company's the
 Company's recorded long-lived assets impairment
 charges of $70 million ($70 million after tax) related to the
 Company's CTS and
 exterior systems operations in Germany.
 At the
 Company's's CTS operations, long-lived asset impairment charges
 of $59 million ($59 million after tax) were recorded related to fixed
 and intangible assets. The impairment charge was calculated based on
 its CTS discounted forecast cashflows and was necessary primarily as
 a result of: (i) a dramatic reduction in the market for soft tops,
 hard tops and modular retractable hard tops; and (ii) historical
 losses that are projected to continue throughout the
 Company'sbusiness planning period.
 At the Company's CTS operations, the
 Company's recorded an $11 million
 ($11 million after tax) asset impairment charge related to specific
 under-utilized assets in Germany.
 During 2009, the
 Company's the
 Company's recorded restructuring and rationalization
 costs of $17 million in cost of goods sold and $3 million in selling,
 general and administrative expense ($20 million after tax). The goodwill impairment charges consist primarily of severance and other termination benefits
 related to the closure of powertrain and interior systems facilities
 in Germany. 4. DETAILS OF CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES(a) Cash and cash equivalents:

 stock options granted and/or modified and the compensation expense
 recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses are as
 follows:

 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 During 2010, option agreements with three departing employees
 were modified resulting in a charge to compensation expense in
 the third and fourth quarters of 2010 of $16 million and
 $4 million, respectively. a charge to compensation expense in
 the third and fourth quarters of 2010 of $16 million and
 $4 million, respectively represents the fair value
 of the options at the date of modification net of originally
 measured compensation cost which has been reversed.
 Compensation expense recorded in selling, general and
 administrative expenses during the three months and year ended
 December 31, 2010 was $10 million (2009 - $2 million), and
 $43 million (2009 - $4 million), respectively.

 adequate borrowing capacity and financial structure to allow
 financial flexibility and to provide an adequate return to
 shareholders. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure,
 the
 Company's may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders,
 issue shares, purchase shares for cancellation, or increase or
 decrease the amount of debt outstanding.
 the

 (b) Fair value
 the
 Company's determined the estimated fair values of the
 Company's financial
 instruments based on valuation methodologies the
 Company's believes are
 appropriate; however, considerable judgment is required to
 develop these estimates. Accordingly, these estimated fair values
 are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the
 Company's could
 realize in a current market exchange. The estimated fair value
 amounts can be materially affected by the use of different
 assumptions or methodologies. The methods and assumptions used to
 estimate the fair value of financial instruments are described
 below:
 Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, bank indebtedness
 and accounts payable.
 Due to the short period to maturity of the instruments, the
 carrying values as presented in the consolidated balance sheets
 are reasonable estimates of fair values.
 Investments
 At December 31, 2010, the
 Company's held Canadian third party
 asset-backed commercial paper (""ABCP"") with a face value of
 Cdn$127 million (December 31, 2009 - Cdn$134 million). The
 carrying value and estimated fair value of this investment was
 Cdn$84 million (December 31, 2009 - Cdn$88 million). As fair
 value information is not readily determinable for the Company's
 investment in ABCP, the fair value was based on a valuation
 technique estimating the fair value from the perspective of a
 market participant.
 At December 31, 2010, the
 Company's held equity investments in
 publicly traded companies. The carrying value and fair value of
 equity investments was $19 million, which was based on the closing
 share price of equity investments on December 31, 2010.
 Term debt
 the
 Company's's term debt includes $25 million due within one year.
 Due to the short period to maturity of this debt, the carrying
 value as presented in the consolidated balance sheet is a
 reasonable estimate of the consolidated balance sheet fair value.
 (c) Credit risk
 the
 Company's's financial assets that are exposed to credit risk
 consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
 receivable, long-term receivables, held to maturity investments,
 and foreign exchange forward contracts with positive fair values.
 The Company's held for trading investments include an investment
 in ABCP. Given the continuing uncertainties regarding the value
 of the underlying assets, the amount and timing over cash flows
 and the risk of collateral calls in the event that spreads
 widened considerably, the
 Company's could be exposed to further
 losses on the
 Company's investment.
 Cash and cash equivalents, which consist of short-term
 investments, are only invested in governments, bank term deposits
 and bank commercial paper with an investment grade credit rating.
 Credit risk is further reduced by limiting the amount which is
 invested in certain governments or any major financial
 institution.
 the
 Company's is also exposed to credit risk from the potential
 default by any of the
 Company's counterparties on the
 Company's derivative
 instruments. the
 Company's the
 Company's mitigates this credit risk by dealing
 with counterparties who are major financial institutions that the
 Company's anticipates will satisfy counterparties who are major financial institutions that the
 Company anticipates obligations under the
 contracts.
 In the normal course of business, the
 Company's the
 Company's is exposed to
 credit risk from the
 Company's customers, substantially all of which are in
 the automotive industry and are subject to credit risks
 associated with the automotive industry. For the three months and
 year ended December 31, 2010, sales to the
 Company's's six largest
 customers represented 85% and 81% of the
 Company's's total sales,
 respectively, and substantially all of Company sales are to customers
 in which the
 Company's has ongoing contractual relationships.
 (d) Currency risk
 the
 Company's is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates
 when manufacturing facilities have committed to the delivery of
 products for which the selling price has been quoted in
 currencies other than the facilities' functional currency, or
 when materials and equipment are purchased in currencies other
 than the facilities' functional currency. In an effort to manage
 this net foreign exchange exposure, the
 Company's the
 Company's employs hedging
 programs, primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward
 contracts.
 As at December 31, 2010, the net foreign exchange exposure was
 not material.
 (e) Interest rate risk
 the
 Company's is not exposed to significant interest rate risk due
 to the short-term maturity of the
 Company's monetary current assets and
 current liabilities. In particular, the amount of interest income
 earned on our cash and cash equivalents is impacted more by the
 investment decisions made and the demands to have available cash
 on hand, than by movements in the interest rates over a given
 period.
 In addition, the
 Company's is not exposed to interest rate risk on
 the
 Company's term debt instruments as the interest rates on these
 instruments are fixed. 15. SEGMENTED INFORMATION In conjunction with the completion of the Arrangement, the Company's
 E-Car Systems partnership is managed separately from the Company's
 other operations which continue to be segmented on a geographic basis
 between North America, Europe, and Rest of World. Consistent with the
 above, the
 Company's's internal financial reporting has been revised to
 separately segment key internal operating performance measures
 between North America, Europe, Rest of World and E-Car Systems for
 purposes of presentation to the chief operating decision maker to
 assist in the assessment of operating performance, the allocation of
 resources, and the long-term strategic direction and future global
 growth of the
 Company's. the
 Company's's reporting to Magna's Corporate
 Executive Team, Board of Directors and shareholders has also been
 revised accordingly.

489,31,2011-02-23,,MILA Aerolight: An emotional study in lightweight construction,,/2011/02/23/mila-aerolight-an-emotional-study-in-lightweight-construction,true,,"February 23, 2011--MAGNA STEYR, an operating unit of Magna International Inc., is presenting its fifth concept vehicle from the MILA (Magna Innovative Lightweight Vehicle) innovation family at the Geneva Motor Show 2011.
MILA Aerolight is a compact, four-seat, natural gas vehicle in the A segment that weighs 700kg and has maximum CO2 emissions of 55g/km. Aerolight stands for tangible lightweight construction. This concept vehicle is distinguished by its highly dynamic styling and use of materials from the aviation industry.
The main characteristics of the MILA Aerolight are:
• Consistent weight reduction through intelligent combination of lightweight materials and unique design strategies
• More efficient CO2 emissions-lower natural gas drive system (CNG)
• Developed from ground up, combining exciting design with innovative lightweight construction, safety and sportiness for maximum driving experience The Design Philosophy MILA Aerolight defines purism and sustainability as new virtues. Esthetics and technology complement each other in an unambiguous design idiom arousing the observers’ emotions. Characteristic features make the lightweight construction tangible through the design. The black passenger compartment evokes a strong sense of security. The hovering shell seals the shape and represents lightness and ideal aerodynamic qualities.
The combination of tangible lightweight construction and perceptible security injects a sense of freshness into the small car segments. This configuration will appeal to design and technology enthusiasts through its dynamic appearance. The Technology Philosophy A multi-material system forms the basis of the MILA Aerolight concept vehicle. This system is distinguished by the use of the right material in the right place. Thus, new features of structure and function evolve. The body consists of a structural frame optimally adapted to stress and of a polymer shell. Considerable reductions in weight are achieved due to the honeycomb structures and innovative composite materials. In this way, all safety requirements – especially with regard to protection of pedestrians – are fulfilled, while simultaneously improving insulation and acoustic properties. Furthermore, there are module solutions with integrated functions. Among these, for example, are an axle with stabilizers, a structurally embedded back seat and a digital viewing system.
The drive system is in the form of a two-cylinder CNG engine. The natural gas is stored in a 55-liter high pressure tank. This corresponds to a gas weight of 8 kg. The tank is integrated in the shape of a cylinder in the center tunnel of the vehicle, taking into account optimum use of space. With respect to vehicle safety, this position of the pressure tank offers considerable advantages on retrofitted systems. Moreover, compared to traditional multipart tank systems, clear cost savings result from the use of a single pressure tank. The tank capacity aims at a range of some 400 km and is therefore fully suited to everyday use. 
The combination of innovative lightweight materials with an efficient and reduced CNG drive system enables extremely low CO2 emissions with a maximum of 55g/km. This is currently the minimum value in the small car segment, and it can be further diminished by enriching with bio-gas. From Concept to Reality With the well-proven flex plant concept, MAGNA STEYR is well positioned to carry out multi-material construction techniques along with conventional body construction in steel and aluminum.
Utilizing lightweight multi-material construction techniques allows parts to be produced from more cost-intensive materials at reduced investment costs resulting in potential costs savings at medium volumes. About Magna Steyr With over one hundred years of experience, MAGNA STEYR’s range of services makes us the worldwide leading, brand-independent engineering and manufacturing partner for OEMs and provider of innovative solutions for future mobility. We strive to consolidate our leading position in the industry with our own innovative ideas and new developments.

We also have the balance sheet, cash flow generation, engineering and manufacturing footprints, technologies and motivated workforce to support our growth initiatives around the world. These factors combined leave us confident about Magna's future."" For the full year 2011, we expect consolidated total sales to be between $25.6 billion and $27.1 billion, and expect consolidated production sales to be between $21.7 billion and $22.7 billion, based on full year 2011 light vehicle production volumes of approximately 12.9 million units in North America and approximately 13.3 million units in Western Europe. We expect full year 2011 production sales to be between $12.7 billion and $13.2 billion in North America, between $7.8 billion and $8.1 billion in Europe and between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion in Rest of World. We expect full year 2011 complete vehicle assembly sales to be between $2.4 billion and $2.7 billion. We expect our 2011 effective income tax rate to be approximately 20%. In addition, we expect that our full year 2011 spending for fixed assets will be between $900 million and $1.0 billion. This amount reflects continuing investment to support new and replacement business in our traditional markets as well as investment to expand in a number of high-growth markets. Finally, in addition to our 2011 sales outlook above, we expect a net increase in total production sales over the two-year period from 2011 to 2013 of approximately $3 billion, based on assumed full year 2013 light vehicle production volumes of approximately 14.8 million units in North America and approximately 14.1 million units in Western Europe.

CTS Fahrzeug-Dachsysteme GmbH, Bietigheim-Bissingen, Germany presents a completely new vehicle concept in cooperation with Bertone: A 7-seat Minivan with open air feeling.Based on a market study, CTS decided to use a minivan well established in the market. The Libertin, combining the functionality of a Minivan with the emotionality of a convertible, gives a prospect of a new vehicle segment, which offers best possible variability and sets the standard for light and brightness in the passenger compartment. The requirement was to integrate a simple, conclusive roof concept, with the van-design, into an existing vehicle.Roof system:The German convertible specialists developed a three-piece Retractable Hardtop with a visible roof frame of carbon fibre. The glued on roof parts of laminated safety glass with thermal insulation open in 30 seconds and reveal a unique, continuous opening of the roof (2040 mm x 850 mm) from the header to the backlite. The lateral roof pillars remain fixed and body mounted and serve as accommodation of the latching system.Deck lid:The deck lid was completely new designed and can be opened over a vertical axis of rotation, fixed on the left side, so that the vehicle can be loaded from the sidewalk. The backlite can be lowered electrically by remote control.Seats:The development departments of both companies aimed to maintain the functionalities of the base vehicle, an OPEL Zafira of the latest generation. A substantial success of the OPEL Zafira is the Flex7-Seating System with 7 seats. When the roof is closed, 7 seats can be used in the show car without restriction. When the roof is open, at least 5 seats can be used.Baggage compartment:When the roof is closed the baggage compartment can be used completely and corresponds to the one of the OPEL Zafira. In case the roof is open, luggage up to 20 kg can be stored on an intermediate bottom, which can be installed, dismantled, folded and stowed away manually. When closing, the luggage can remain on the intermediate bottom, since the kinematics slew the roof around the package tray.If the rear seats are not required, the intermediate bottom remains in the vehicle. Then two separate compartments are available, which can be loaded either over the backlite or over the deck lid. If the vehicle is used as convertible, only the upper department may be used, since the lower serves as folding box compartment for the roof.An innovation of this show car is a sensor technique to detect luggage and other objects within the trunk. In case the sensors detect any subjects in the trunk, a signal is sent to the control unit, which blocks the opening of the roof system. This technique prevents the roof system from any damages.Trims:A substantial characteristic of the concept car are the trims. For the first time, the roof kinematics are covered completely in closed state; open rotation points or gaps are traced in vain. During the opening and closing procedure the lateral trim remains bodymounted, and is comparable with a pocket, in which the links disappear elegantly. The main rotating arms and their drive systems are not visible either.CTS opens the roof of the convertible concept carBertone Suagnà Roof ConceptGeneva/Bietigheim-Bissingen. Bertone shows a study of a Fiat Punto Convertible with 4 seats, for which CTS Fahrzeug-Dachsysteme GmbH has developed a two-piece Retractable Hardtop. At present there are only 2+2 seaters in this market segment.This convertible car study is a joint work of Bertone and CTS. A target was the development of an adequate 4 seat convertible with Retractable Hardtop based on the Fiat Punto without extending the trunk of the vehicle.CTS presents a roof concept, which deviates formally from the previous coupé silhouettes, and nevertheless does not neglect the dynamic and distinctive external form. The concept has a steep-standing, concealable backlite, and captivates by a simple system that offers sufficient space for four people.Roof kinematics:The roof consists of a two-piece RHT with concealable backlite. A special highlight is the steep backlite which supersedes a tonneau cover. Besides the backlite can be lowered independently when the roof is closed, so even during bad weather conditions fresh air supply is guaranteed. In contrary, the backlite serves as wind blocker when the roof is opened.

The award, which honors the year’s most innovative use of automotive plastics, was given during the SPE’s 40th Annual Innovation Awards and Gala held in Livonia, Mich., on November 9.Magna Seating was recognized for a new technology that converts post-industrial polyurethane foam scrap into renewed polyol, the key raw material used in the production of polyurethanes. Developed in conjunction with material supplier InfiChem Polymers, this ground-breaking innovation has its first commercial automotive application in the seats of the all-new 2011 Jeep® Grand Cherokee, which are manufactured at Magna Seating’s new Highland Park, Mich., facility.The use of recycled polyols reduces the need for petroleum-based raw materials in the foam manufacturing process, thereby improving the overall carbon footprint of seat foam production. When replacing 1 kg of petroleum-based polyols, CO2 emissions are cut by 2 kg. Additionally, the ability to use scrap foam redirects this material from landfills and reduces overall waste. The closed-loop recycling process does not compete with food-source raw materials since the scrap foam used as a raw material comes from old automotive seat cushions.""Magna Seating is proud of this award and would like to give special mention to our chemical technologies team, which was able to create a healthier and more sustainable option for seat foam production,"" said Magna Seating President Joe Pittel.

Total investment activities for the third quarter of 2010 were $233 million, including $182 million in fixed asset additions, $45 million in investments and other assets and $6 million to purchase subsidiaries. NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2010 ------------------------------------ We posted sales of $17.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, an increase of 47% from the nine months ended September 30, 2009. This higher sales level was a result of increases in our North American, European and Rest of World production sales, complete vehicle assembly sales and tooling, engineering and other sales. During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, vehicle production increased 54% to 9.0 million units in North America and 14% to 9.8 million units in Europe, each compared to the first nine months of 2009. Also during the first nine months of 2010, our North American and European average dollar content per vehicle increased 12% and 10% respectively, each compared to the first nine months of 2009. Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 24% to $1.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, while complete vehicle assembly volumes increased 50% to approximately 61,000 units.

Total investment activities for the first nine months of 2010 were $586 million, including $479 million in fixed asset additions, $99 million in investments and other assets and $8 million to purchase subsidiaries. Don Walker, Magna's Chief Executive Officer commented: ""We continue to generate strong earnings and cash flow, even at historically low levels of vehicle production in our primary markets of North America and Western Europe. The eventual recovery of vehicle production in these markets, combined with our expansion plans in other regions around the world, our strong balance sheet, and our continued efforts to improve underperforming operations all leave us very optimistic about Magna's future operating results."" A more detailed discussion of our consolidated financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2010 is contained in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Position and the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which are attached to this Press Release. STOCK SPLIT ----------- Our Board of Directors has approved a two-for-one stock split of the company's outstanding common shares. The two-for-one stock split will be implemented by way of a stock dividend. Subject to regulatory approval, shareholders will receive one additional common share of Magna for each common share held. The stock dividend will be payable on November 24, 2010, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 16, 2010. Shareholders should retain their existing share certificates and not return their share certificates to Magna or its transfer agent. Magna's common shares are expected to begin trading on a split basis on the Toronto Stock Exchange on November 12, 2010 and on the New York Stock Exchange on November 26, 2010. Magna is ascribing no monetary value to the stock dividend. All of Magna's equity-based compensation plans and arrangements will be adjusted to reflect the issuance of additional shares due to the stock split. Vince Galifi, Magna's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer stated: ""The decision to announce a stock split at this time reflects the Board's confidence in our future."" INCREASED QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND --------------------------------- Our Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend with respect to our outstanding Common Shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2010. In light of Magna's performance, the Board decided to increase the dividend by 20% to U.S. $0.18 per share after giving effect to the two-for-one stock split referred to above (this equates to a dividend of U.S. $0.36 per share on a pre stock split basis). This dividend is payable on December 15, 2010 to shareholders of record on November 30, 2010. NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID ------------------------ Subject to approval by the Toronto Stock Exchange (""TSX"") and the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE""), our Board of Directors approved a normal course issuer bid to purchase up to 4.0 million of our Common Shares (adjusted to 8.0 million shares on a post stock split basis), representing approximately 3.3% of the outstanding Common Shares. The primary purposes of the normal course issuer bid are purchases for cancellation to offset potential dilution resulting from the exercise of stock options, for purchases to fund the Company's restricted stock unit program and its obligations under its deferred profit sharing plans. The normal course issuer bid is expected to commence on or about November 10, 2010 and will terminate one year later. All purchases of Common Shares will be made at the market price at the time of purchase in accordance with the rules and policies of the TSX. Purchases may also be made on the NYSE in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. GOVERNANCE ---------- As previously announced, in connection with the elimination of our dual class structure effective August 31, 2010, our Chairman, Frank Stronach, has resigned as a member of the Nominating Committee of our Board of Directors. This vacancy was filled today by the Board's appointment of Louis Lataif, Dean Emeritus of Boston University School of Management and former President of Ford Europe. The Nominating Committee is now comprised entirely of independent directors and, consistent with its mandate, will undertake a comprehensive review of the Board's composition with a view to ensuring that the Board continues to have the capabilities to oversee our operations globally. The Nominating Committee plans to retain an internationally recognized firm to assist in its search for potential future Board members as part of this review process. 2010 OUTLOOK ------------ For the full year 2010, we expect our sales to be between $23.5 billion and $24.0 billion, based on full year 2010 light vehicle production volumes of approximately 11.8 million units in North America and approximately 12.6 million units in Europe. Full year 2010 average dollar content per vehicle is expected to be between $980 and $995 in North America and between $545 and $555 in Europe. We expect our full year 2010 complete vehicle assembly sales to be between $2.05 billion and $2.15 billion. In addition, we expect that full year 2010 spending for fixed assets will be in the range of $740 million to $775 million. This 2010 outlook assumes no significant acquisitions or divestitures. In addition, we have assumed that foreign exchange rates for the most common currencies in which we conduct business relative to our U.S. dollar reporting currency will approximate current rates. ABOUT MAGNA ----------- We are the most diversified global automotive supplier. We design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced automotive systems, assemblies, modules and components, and engineer and assemble complete vehicles, primarily for sale to original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"") of cars and light trucks.

We design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced automotive systems, assemblies, modules and components, and engineer and assemble complete vehicles, primarily for sale to original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"") of cars and light trucks. Our capabilities include the design, engineering, testing and manufacture of automotive interior systems; seating systems; closure systems; body and chassis systems; vision systems; electronic systems; exterior systems; powertrain systems; roof systems; hybrid and electric vehicles/systems; as well as complete vehicle engineering and assembly. We follow a corporate policy of functional and operational decentralization, pursuant to which we conduct our operations through divisions, each of which is an autonomous business unit operating within pre-determined guidelines. As at September 30, 2010, we had 245 manufacturing operations and 80 product development, engineering and sales centres in 25 countries. HIGHLIGHTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- In the third quarter of 2010, North American light vehicle production increased 28% relative to the third quarter of 2009, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year increases. Third quarter 2010 light vehicle production in North America declined only 4% from the second quarter of 2010, a much less dramatic seasonal decline than is historically experienced. In Western Europe, light vehicle production declined approximately 1% from the third quarter of 2009, a quarter in which European vehicle sales and production were supported by vehicle ""scrappage"" programs in a number of European countries. However, 2010 Western European production has remained stronger than we anticipated. Our total sales for the third quarter of 2010 increased 27% over the third quarter of 2009. As was the case in the second quarter of 2010, North American, European and Rest of World production sales, as well as complete vehicle assembly sales and tooling, engineering and other sales all exceeded third quarter of 2009 levels. Third quarter 2010 operating income increased $236 million to $317 million, compared to operating income of $81 million for the third quarter of 2009. Our continued strong operating results reflect, among other things: - improved light vehicle production in North America;
 - the ongoing benefit of our efforts over the past few years to
 restructure and right-size our operations, as well as to reduce costs
 across the organization;
 - the benefit of our efforts to improve underperforming operations
 around the world;
 - the benefit of a commercial settlement with a customer related to the
 recovery of previously expensed engineering and design costs; and
 - an accounts receivable valuation allowance in the third quarter of
 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by a stock-based compensation charge as a result of modifying option agreements following the resignation of two employees. Stock Split Our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split, to be implemented by way of a stock dividend, whereby our shareholders will receive an additional Common Share for each Common Share held. The stock dividend will be payable on November 24, 2010, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 16, 2010. All equity-based compensation plans or arrangements and our normal course issuer bid (discussed below) will be adjusted to reflect the issuance of additional Common Shares due to the declaration of the stock split. Increase in Dividend Our Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend with respect to our outstanding Common Shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2010. In light of Magna's performance, the Board decided to increase the dividend by 20% to U.S. $0.18 per share after giving effect to the two-for-one stock split referred to above (this equates to a dividend of U.S. $0.36 per share on a pre stock split basis). This dividend is payable on December 15, 2010 to shareholders of record on November 30, 2010. Normal Course Issuer Bid Subject to approval by the Toronto Stock Exchange (""TSX"") and the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE""), our Board of Directors approved a normal course issuer bid to purchase up to 4.0 million of our issued and outstanding Common Shares (adjusted to 8.0 million shares on a post stock split basis), representing approximately 3.3% of our outstanding Common Shares. The primary purposes of the normal course issuer bid are purchases for cancellation to offset potential dilution resulting from the exercise of stock options, and/or for purchases to fund our restricted stock unit program and our obligations to our deferred profit sharing plans. The normal course issuer bid is expected to commence on or about November 10, 2010 and will terminate one year later. All purchases of Common Shares will be made at the market price at the time of purchase in accordance with the rules and policies of the TSX. Purchases may also be made on the NYSE in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Plan of Arrangement On August 31, 2010, following approval by our Class A Subordinate Voting and Class B Shareholders, we completed the court-approved plan of arrangement (the ""Arrangement"") with the Stronach group whereby our dual-class share structure was collapsed. The transaction also: (i) set a termination date and declining fee schedule for the consulting, business development and business services contracts Magna has in place with Frank Stronach and his affiliated entities; and (ii) established a partnership with the Stronach group to pursue opportunities in the vehicle electrification business. (a) Capital Transaction We purchased for cancellation all 726,829 outstanding Class B Shares, which were held indirectly by the Stronach group, for $300 million in cash and 9.0 million newly issued Class A Subordinate Voting Shares. The newly issued shares held indirectly by the Stronach group represented an equal equity ownership and voting interest of 7.4% as of August 31, 2010. Issue costs related to the issuance of these shares were $13 million. In addition, Magna's Articles were amended to remove the Class B Shares from the authorized capital and to make non-substantive consequential changes to its Articles, including renaming the Class A Subordinate Voting Shares as Common Shares and eliminating provisions which no longer apply due to the elimination of the Class B Shares. (b) Vehicle Electrification Partnership The partnership involves the engineering, development and integration of electric vehicles of any type, the development, testing and manufacturing of batteries and battery packs for hybrid (H) and electric vehicles (EV) and all ancillary activities in connection with electric vehicle technologies. Our original investment in the partnership included the assets of our recently established E-Car Systems vehicle electrification and battery business unit, certain other vehicle electrification assets, and $145 million in cash. On August 31, 2010, the Stronach group invested $80 million in cash for a 27% equity interest in the partnership, reducing our equity interest to 73%. The partnership is controlled by the Stronach group. Governance As previously announced, in connection with the elimination of our dual class structure effective August 31, 2010, our Chairman, Frank Stronach, has resigned as a member of the Nominating Committee of our Board of Directors. This vacancy was filled today by the Board's appointment of Louis Lataif, Dean Emeritus of Boston University School of Management and former President of Ford Europe. The Nominating Committee is now comprised entirely of independent directors and, consistent with its mandate, will undertake a comprehensive review of the Board's composition with a view to ensuring that the Board continues to have the capabilities to oversee our operations globally. The Nominating Committee plans to retain an internationally recognized firm to assist in its search for potential future Board members as part of this review process. FINANCIAL RESULTS SUMMARY ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the third quarter of 2010, we posted sales of $5.9 billion, an increase of 27% from the third quarter of 2009. This higher sales level was a result of increases in our North American, European and Rest of World production sales, complete vehicle assembly sales and tooling, engineering and other sales. Comparing the third quarter of 2010 to the third quarter of 2009: - North American vehicle production increased by 28% and average dollar
 content per vehicle increased 9%;
 - European vehicle production decreased 1% while average dollar content
 per vehicle increased 8%;
 - Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 21% to $519 million, as
 complete vehicle assembly volumes increased 41%;
 - Rest of World production sales increased 29% to $249 million from
 $193 million; and
 - Tooling, engineering and other sales increased 52% to $502 million
 from $330 million.
 During the third quarter of 2010, we generated operating income of $317 million compared to $81 million for the third quarter of 2009. The $236 million increase in operating income was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes in North America. In addition, operating income was positively impacted by: - the $33 million benefit of a commercial settlement with a customer
 related to the recovery of previously expensed engineering and design
 costs;
 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs;
 - a $16 million accounts receivable valuation allowance in the third
 quarter of 2009;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - lower warranty costs;
 - lower costs incurred related to launches or for programs that have
 not fully ramped up production.
 These factors were partially offset by: - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities, in
 particular at certain electronics, and exteriors and interiors
 systems facilities in Europe;
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - a $16 million stock-based compensation charge as a result of
 modifying option agreements following the resignation of two
 employees;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - a $9 million favourable revaluation of our investment in asset-backed
 commercial paper (""ABCP"") in the third quarter of 2009;
 - increased stock-based compensation; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the third quarter of
 2009.
 During the third quarter of 2010, net income increased $190 million to $241 million compared to $51 million for the third quarter of 2009. The increase in net income was a result of the increase in operating income partially offset by higher income taxes. During the third quarter of 2010, our diluted earnings per share increased by $1.61 to $2.06 compared to $0.45 for the third quarter of 2009. The increase in diluted earnings per share is as a result of the increase in net income partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the third quarter of 2010. The increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to the net issue of shares during the third quarter of 2010 related to the Arrangement and an increase in the number of diluted shares associated with stock options.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) Restructuring and Impairment Charges (a) For the nine months ended September 30, 2010 During the second quarter of 2010, we recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $21 million in cost of goods sold and $3 million in selling, general and administrative expense related to the planned closure of a powertrain systems facility and two body & chassis systems facilities in North America. (b) For the nine months ended September 30, 2009 During the second quarter of 2009, after failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York, we decided to wind down these operations. Given the significance of the facility's cashflows in relation to the reporting unit, we determined that it was more likely than not that goodwill at the Powertrain North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired. Therefore, we recorded a $75 million goodwill impairment charge. The goodwill impairment charge was calculated by determining the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if we had acquired the reporting unit as at June 30, 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, we recorded restructuring costs of $6 million related to the planned closure of this powertrain systems facility. (2) Curtailment gain During the second quarter of 2009, we amended our Retiree Premium Reimbursement Plan in Canada and the United States, such that most employees retiring on or after August 1, 2009 would no longer participate in the plan. The amendment reduced service costs and retirement medical benefit expense in 2009 and future years. As a result of amending the plan, a curtailment gain of $26 million was recorded in cost of goods sold in the second quarter of 2009. (3) Sale of Facility During the first quarter of 2010, we sold our interest in an electronics systems joint venture in China and realized a $14 million gain. INDUSTRY TRENDS AND RISKS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our success is primarily dependent upon the levels of North American and European car and light truck production by our customers and the relative amount of content we have on the various programs. OEM production volumes in different regions may be impacted by factors which may vary from one region to the next, including but not limited to general economic and political conditions, interest rates, credit availability, energy and fuel prices, international conflicts, labour relations issues, regulatory requirements, trade agreements, infrastructure, legislative changes, and environmental emissions and safety issues. These factors and a number of other economic, industry and risk factors which also affect our success, including such things as relative currency values, commodities prices, price reduction pressures from our customers, the financial condition of our supply base and competition from manufacturers with operations in low cost countries, are discussed in our Annual Information Form and Annual Report on Form 40-F, each in respect of the year ended December 31, 2009, and remain substantially unchanged in respect of the third quarter ended September 30, 2010. In addition to the risk factors referenced above, our partnership with the Stronach group to pursue opportunities in the vehicle electrification business is subject to a number of additional risks. These additional risk factors are discussed in Magna's Management Information Circular/Proxy Statement, dated May 31, 2010, under the heading ""Risks Relating to the Vehicle Electrification Joint Venture.""

 The preceding table reflects the average foreign exchange rates between the most common currencies in which we conduct business and our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The significant changes in these foreign exchange rates for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2010 impacted the reported U.S. dollar amounts of our sales, expenses and income. The results of operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates in the table above for the relevant period. Throughout this MD&A, reference is made to the impact of translation of foreign operations on reported U.S. dollar amounts where relevant. Our results can also be affected by the impact of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency transactions (such as raw material purchases or sales denominated in foreign currencies). However, as a result of hedging programs employed by us, foreign currency transactions in the current period have not been fully impacted by movements in exchange rates. We record foreign currency transactions at the hedged rate where applicable. Finally, holding gains and losses on foreign currency denominated monetary items, which are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, impact reported results.

 External Production Sales - North America External production sales in North America increased 39% or $0.8 billion to $3.0 billion for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $2.2 billion for the third quarter of 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 28% increase in North American vehicle production volumes combined with a 9% increase in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. Our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 9% or $83 to $1,010 for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $927 for the third quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the third quarter
 of 2009, including the:
 - Jeep Grand Cherokee;
 - Ford Fiesta;
 - GMC Terrain; and
 - Cadillac SRX;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening of
 the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar; and
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave; and
 - Chevrolet Equinox.
 These factors were partially offset by: - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the Ford Escape, Mercury Mariner and
 Mazda Tribute;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the third
 quarter of 2009, including the Pontiac and Saturn brands; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the third quarter of
 2009.
 External Production Sales - Europe External production sales in Europe increased 7% or $0.10 billion to $1.65 billion for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $1.55 billion for the third quarter of 2009. This increase in production sales reflects an 8% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle partially offset by a 1% decrease in European vehicle production volumes. Our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 8% or $42 to $571 for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $529 for the third quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the third quarter
 of 2009, including the:
 - MINI Countryman;
 - Peugeot RCZ;
 - Porsche Cayenne and Volkswagen Touareg;
 - Audi A1;
 - Opel Astra; and
 - Mercedes-Benz SLS;
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - Volkswagen Tiguan;
 - Audi Q5;
 - BMW X1;
 - Porsche Panamera; and
 - Ford Transit; and
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to the third quarter of
 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by: - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the
 euro and British pound, each against the U.S. dollar;
 - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - smart fortwo;
 - Mercedes-Benz B-Class;
 - Honda Civic; and
 - Volkswagen Golf;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the third
 quarter of 2009; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the third quarter of
 2009.
 External Production Sales - Rest of World External production sales in Rest of World increased 29% or $56 million to $249 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $193 million for the third quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - increased production and/or content on certain programs in China and
 Korea;
 - the acquisition of a Japanese roof systems facility in the first
 quarter of 2010;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the third quarter
 of 2009 in China; and
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales as a result of the
 strengthening of the Korean Won and Chinese Renminbi, each against
 the U.S. dollar.
 These factors were partially offset by the sale of our interest in an electronics systems joint venture in China in the first quarter of 2010. Complete Vehicle Assembly Sales The terms of our various vehicle assembly contracts differ with respect to the ownership of components and supplies related to the assembly process and the method of determining the selling price to the OEM customer. Under certain contracts we are acting as principal, and purchased components and systems in assembled vehicles are included in our inventory and cost of sales. These costs are reflected on a full-cost basis in the selling price of the final assembled vehicle to the OEM customer. Other contracts provide that third-party components and systems are held on consignment by us, and the selling price to the OEM customer reflects a value-added assembly fee only. Production levels of the various vehicles assembled by us have an impact on the level of our sales and profitability. In addition, the relative proportion of programs accounted for on a full-cost basis and programs accounted for on a value-added basis also impacts our level of sales and operating margin percentage, but may not necessarily affect our overall level of profitability. Assuming no change in total vehicles assembled, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a full-cost basis has the effect of increasing the level of total sales, however, because purchased components are included in cost of sales, profitability as a percentage of total sales is reduced. Conversely, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a value-added basis has the effect of reducing the level of total sales and increasing profitability as a percentage of total sales.

 Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 21% or $91 million to $519 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $428 million for the third quarter of 2009, while assembly volumes increased 41% or 5,990 units. The increase in complete vehicle assembly sales is primarily as a result of: - the launch of new assembly programs subsequent to the third quarter
 of 2009, including the:
 - MINI Countryman;
 - Peugeot RCZ; and
 - Aston Martin Rapide; and
 - an increase in assembly volumes for the Mercedes-Benz G-Class.
 These factors were partially offset by the end of production on certain assembly programs at our Magna Steyr facility, including the: - BMW X3 in the third quarter of 2010;
 - Saab 9(3) Convertible in the fourth quarter of 2009; and
 - Chrysler 300 and Jeep Grand Cherokee in the second quarter of 2010.
 In addition, complete vehicle assembly sales were negatively impacted by a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. Tooling, Engineering and Other Tooling, engineering and other sales increased 52% or $172 million to $502 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $330 million for the third quarter of 2009. In the third quarter of 2010, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - MINI Cooper and Countryman;
 - Jeep Grand Cherokee;
 - BMW X3;
 - Mercedes-Benz M-Class;
 - Porsche Cayenne;
 - Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra; and
 - Chevrolet Volt.
 In the third quarter of 2009, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - Opel/Vauxhall Astra;
 - MINI Cooper and Countryman;
 - Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra;
 - BMW X3;
 - Ford F-Series;
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Opel Insignia;
 - Ford Freestar; and
 - Audi Q5.
 In addition, tooling, engineering and other sales decreased as a result of the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. Gross Margin Gross margin increased $258 million to $810 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $552 million for the third quarter of 2009 and gross margin as a percentage of total sales increased to 13.6% for the third quarter of 2010 compared to 11.8% for the third quarter of 2009. The 1.8% increase in gross margin as a percentage of total sales was substantially due to increased gross margin earned as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes in North America. In addition, gross margin as a percentage of total sales was positively impacted by: - the $33 million benefit of a commercial settlement with a customer
 related to the recovery of previously expensed engineering and design
 costs;
 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - lower warranty costs; and
 - lower costs incurred related to launches or for programs that have
 not fully ramped up production.
 These factors were partially offset by: - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities, in
 particular at certain electronics, and exteriors and interiors
 systems facilities in Europe;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - increased commodity costs; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the third quarter of
 2009.
 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization costs decreased 13% or $25 million to $161 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $186 million for the third quarter of 2009. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily as a result of: - the impairment of certain assets subsequent to the third quarter of
 2009;
 - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar depreciation and amortization due
 to the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar; and
 - the disposition of certain facilities subsequent to the third quarter
 of 2009.
 Selling, General and Administrative (""SG&A"") SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 5.8% for the third quarter of 2010, compared to 6.1% for the third quarter of 2009. SG&A expense increased $56 million to $342 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $286 million for the third quarter of 2009. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily as a result of: - higher incentive compensation;
 - a $16 million stock-based compensation charge as a result of
 modifying option agreements following the resignation of two
 employees;
 - a $9 million favourable revaluation of our investment in ABCP in the
 third quarter of 2009;
 - higher costs to support the increased sales level; and
 - higher stock-based compensation.
 These factors were partially offset by: - a $16 million accounts receivable valuation allowance in the third
 quarter of 2009;
 - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar SG&A due to the weakening of the
 euro against the U.S. dollar;
 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs; and
 - the closure or disposition of certain facilities during or subsequent
 to the third quarter of 2009.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) EBIT is defined as income (loss) from operations before income taxes and minority interest as presented on our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements before net interest (income) expense. North America EBIT in North America increased $168 million to $276 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $108 million for the third quarter of 2009. The increase in EBIT was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - lower warranty costs;
 - a $3 million accounts receivable valuation allowance in the third
 quarter of 2009; and
 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs.
 These factors were partially offset by: - increased commodity costs;
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the third quarter of
 2009.
 Europe EBIT in Europe increased $58 million to $11 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $47 million for the third quarter of 2009 due to: - lower costs incurred related to launches or for programs that have
 not fully ramped up production;
 - a $13 million accounts receivable valuation allowance in the third
 quarter of 2009;
 - lower warranty costs; and
 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs.
 These factors were partially offset by: - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities, in
 particular at certain electronics, and exteriors and interiors
 systems facilities;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher management compensation; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the third quarter of
 2009.
 Rest of World Rest of World EBIT increased $1 million to $19 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $18 million for the third quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - additional margin earned on increased production sales; and
 - incremental margin earned on new programs that launched during or
 subsequent to the third quarter of 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the write-off of certain assets; and
 - the sale of our interest in an electronics systems joint venture in
 China in the first quarter of 2010.
 E-Car Systems E-Car Systems EBIT decreased $3 million to a loss of $16 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $13 million for the third quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of higher development and launch costs. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other EBIT increased $7 million to $24 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $17 million for the third quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - the $33 million benefit of a commercial settlement with a customer
 related to the recovery of previously expensed engineering and design
 costs;
 - an increase in affiliation fees earned from our divisions;
 - the positive impact of foreign exchange; and
 - an increase in equity income earned.
 These factors were partially offset by: - a $16 million stock-based compensation charge as a result of
 modifying option agreements following the resignation of two
 employees;
 - a $9 million favourable revaluation of our investment in ABCP in the
 third quarter of 2009;
 - higher incentive compensation; and
 - higher stock-based compensation.
 Interest (Income) Expense, net During the third quarter of 2010, we recorded net interest income of $3 million compared to $2 million of net interest expense for the third quarter of 2009. The $5 million increase in net interest income is as a result of a reduction in interest expense due to the repayment of our 7.08% Subordinated Debentures during the third quarter of 2009 and our 6.5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures subsequent to the third quarter of 2009. Operating Income Operating income increased $236 million to $317 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $81 million for the third quarter of 2009. The increase in operating income is the result of the increase in EBIT and the decrease in net interest expense, both as discussed above. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate on operating income (excluding equity income) decreased to 24.8% for the third quarter of 2010 compared to 38.5% for the third quarter of 2009. The effective income tax rate decreased primarily due to the utilization of losses that were previously not benefited, mainly in the United States. Minority Interest During the third quarter of 2010, we recorded $1 million of minority interest recovery with respect to the loss incurred in our E-Car systems partnership for the month of September. Net Income Net income increased $190 million to $241 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $51 million for the third quarter of 2009. The increase in net income is the result of the increase in operating income partially offset by higher income taxes, both as discussed above. Earnings per Share For the three

 Diluted earnings per share increased $1.61 to $2.06 for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $0.45 for the third quarter of 2009 as a result of the increase in net income, described above, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the quarter. The increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to the net issue of shares during the third quarter of 2010 related to the Arrangement and an increase in the number of diluted shares associated with stock options.

 Cash flow from operations before changes in non-cash operating assets and liabilities increased $164 million to $422 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $258 million for the third quarter of 2009. The increase in cash flow from operations was due to a $190 million increase in net income, as discussed above, partially offset by a $26 million decrease in items not involving current cash flows. The decrease in items not involving current cash flows was primarily as a result of a $25 million decrease in depreciation and amortization and a $34 million decrease in other non-cash charges (including the previously discussed benefit of the commercial settlement) offset in part by the $40 million increase in future income taxes and non-cash portion of current taxes. Items not involving current cash flows are comprised of the following: For the three

 The increases in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable in the third quarter of 2010 was primarily due to the increase in production activities at the end of the third quarter of 2010 compared to the end of the second quarter of 2010 and new program launches. The increase in income taxes payable was primarily due to a higher income tax provision, resulting from increased earnings in excess of required instalment payments, as well as the receipt of income tax refunds.

 Fixed and other assets additions In the third quarter of 2010, we invested $182 million in fixed assets. While investments were made to refurbish or replace assets consumed in the normal course of business and for productivity improvements, a large portion of the investment in the third quarter of 2010 was for manufacturing equipment for programs that will be launching subsequent to the third quarter of 2010. In the third quarter of 2010, we invested $42 million in other assets related primarily to fully reimbursable tooling costs at our body & chassis systems operations and planning and engineering costs at powertrain systems operations for programs that will be launching subsequent to the third quarter of 2010. Purchase of subsidiaries During the third quarter of 2010, we invested $6 million to purchase subsidiaries. Proceeds from disposition Proceeds from disposition in the third quarter of 2010 were $52 million which included: a cash payment received on the sale of a long-term receivable related to fully reimbursable capitalized pre-production costs; and normal course fixed and other asset disposals.

 During the third quarter of 2010, we repaid $29 million of debt assumed on the acquisition of Cadence Innovation s.r.o. (""Cadence""). In connection with the Arrangement, during the third quarter of 2010, we purchased for cancellation all 726,829 outstanding Class B Shares for $300 million. In addition, the Stronach group invested $80 million in the Vehicle Electrification Partnership. In August of 2010 our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.30 per Common Share or Class B Share in respect of the second quarter of 2010. These dividends, which aggregated to $38 million, were paid in the third quarter of 2010. Financing Resources As at As at

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Total capitalization increased by $0.52 billion to $8.06 billion at September 30, 2010 compared to $7.54 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase in capitalization was a result of a $493 million increase in shareholders' equity and an $84 million increase in minority interest partially offset by a $59 million decrease in liabilities. The increase in shareholders' equity was primarily as a result of: - net income earned during the first nine months of 2010;
 - net unrealized gains on cash flow hedges, and the reclassification of
 net gains on cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive
 income to net income; and
 - an increase in contributed surplus related to stock-based
 compensation expense.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the repurchase of Class B Shares in connection with the Arrangement;
 and
 - dividends paid during the second and third quarters of 2010.
 The increase in minority interest was as a result of the formation of the E-Car partnership. The decrease in liabilities is primarily as a result of the repayment of debt in the second and third quarters of 2010 assumed on the acquisition of Cadence. Cash Resources During the first nine months of 2010, our cash resources increased by $0.3 billion to $1.7 billion primarily as a result of the cash provided from operating activities partially offset by cash used for investing activities and financing activities (including cash used for the Arrangement), as discussed above. In addition to our cash resources, we had term and operating lines of credit totalling $2.0 billion. The unused and available portion of our lines of credit was unchanged at $1.9 billion during the first nine months of 2010. Maximum Number of Shares Issuable The following table presents the maximum number of shares that would be outstanding if all of the outstanding options at November 4, 2010 were exercised: Common Shares 121,175,773

 External Production Sales - North America External production sales in North America increased 72% or $3.7 billion to $8.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to $5.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 54% increase in North American vehicle production volumes combined with a 12% increase in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. Our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 12% or $106 to $979 for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to $873 for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, primarily as a result of: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the nine months
 ended September 30, 2009, including the:
 - Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain;
 - Jeep Grand Cherokee;
 - Cadillac SRX; and
 - Chevrolet Cruze;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening of
 the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar;
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and Volkswagen
 Routan;
 - Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave;
 - GM full-sized SUVs;
 - Dodge Journey; and
 - Jeep Wrangler; and
 - the acquisition of several facilities from Meridian Automotive
 Systems Inc. in the third quarter of 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by: - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the nine
 months ended September 30, 2009, including the Pontiac and Saturn
 brands;
 - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the Ford Escape, Mercury Mariner and
 Mazda Tribute; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the nine months ended
 September 30, 2009.
 External Production Sales - Europe External production sales in Europe increased 25% or $1.05 billion to $5.18 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to $4.13 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 14% increase in European vehicle production volumes combined with a 10% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. Our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 10% or $46 to $530 for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to $484 for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, primarily as a result of: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the nine months
 ended September 30, 2009, including the:
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Peugeot RCZ;
 - Mercedes-Benz SLS;
 - Opel Astra;
 - MINI Countryman; and
 - Skoda Yeti;
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to the nine months ended
 September 30, 2009, including Cadence; and
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the BMW X1.
 These factors were partially offset by: - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the
 euro, against the U.S. dollar;
 - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the smart fortwo; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the nine months ended
 September 30, 2009.
 External Production Sales - Rest of World External production sales in Rest of World increased 62% or $284 million to $739 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to $455 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, primarily as a result of: - increased production and/or content on certain programs in China,
 Korea, Brazil and South Africa;
 - the acquisition of a Japanese roof systems facility in the first
 quarter of 2010;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the third quarter
 of 2009 in China and Japan; and
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales as a result of the
 strengthening of the Brazilian real and Korean Won, both against the
 U.S. dollar.
 These factors were partially offset by the sale of our interest in an electronics systems joint venture in China in the first quarter of 2010. Complete Vehicle Assembly Sales For the nine

The increase in complete vehicle assembly sales is primarily as a result of: - the launch of new assembly programs subsequent to the nine months
 ended September 30, 2009, including the:
 - Peugeot RCZ;
 - Aston Martin Rapide; and
 - MINI Countryman; and
 - an increase in assembly volumes for the Mercedes-Benz G-Class.

 - Saab 9(3) Convertible in the fourth quarter of 2009; and
 - Chrysler 300 and Jeep Grand Cherokee in the second quarter of 2010.

 North America EBIT in North America increased $990 million to $825 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to a loss of $165 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. Excluding the North American unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $959 million increase in EBIT was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives undertaken during or subsequent to the nine months
 ended September 30, 2009;
 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities; and
 - lower warranty costs.
 These factors were partially offset by: - higher affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - increased commodity costs; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the nine months ended
 September 30, 2009.
 Europe EBIT in Europe increased $295 million to $98 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to a loss of $197 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - favourable settlement of certain commercial items;
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence;
 - a $10 million recovery, during the first nine months 2010, of
 receivables that had a $13 million accounts receivable valuation
 allowance recorded in the third quarter of 2009;
 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs;
 - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives undertaken during or subsequent to the nine months
 ended September 30, 2009;
 - the sale or closure of certain underperforming divisions subsequent
 to the nine months ended September 30, 2009;
 - lower costs incurred related to launches or for programs that have
 not fully ramped up production; and
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities.
 These factors were partially offset by: - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities, in
 particular at certain electronics, and exteriors and interiors
 systems facilities;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher warranty costs;
 - higher affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - higher incentive compensation; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the third quarter of
 2009.
 Rest of World EBIT in Rest of World increased $51 million to $76 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to $25 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. Excluding the Rest of World unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $37 million increase in EBIT was primarily as a result of: - additional margin earned on increased production sales; and
 - incremental margin earned on new programs that launched during or
 subsequent to the nine months ended September 30, 2009.
 E-Car Systems E-Car Systems EBIT decreased $24 million to a loss of $52 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to a loss of $28 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, primarily as a result of higher development and launch costs. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other EBIT increased $35 million to $22 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to a loss of $13 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, primarily as a result of: - the $33 million benefit of a commercial settlement with a customer
 related to the recovery of previously expensed engineering and design
 costs;
 - an increase in affiliation fees earned from our divisions;
 - the positive impact of foreign exchange; and
 - an increase in equity income earned.
 These factors were partially offset by: - increased incentive compensation; and
 - a $16 million stock-based compensation charge as a result of
 modifying option agreements following the resignation of two
 employees;
 - a $9 million favourable revaluation of our investment in asset-backed
 commercial paper in the third quarter of 2009; and
 - increased stock-based compensation.

 See accompanying notes MAGNA INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Unaudited)(All amounts in U.S. dollars and all tabular amounts in millions unlessotherwise noted) ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Magna International Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively ""Magna"" or the ""Company"") have been prepared in United States dollars following Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") with respect to the preparation of interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required in the preparation of annual financial statements and therefore should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2009 audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's 2009 Annual Report. These interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the same accounting policies as the December 31, 2009 annual consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which consist only of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position at September 30, 2010 and the results of operations and cash flows for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 and 2009. Seasonality Our businesses are generally not seasonal. However, our sales and profits are closely related to our automotive customers' vehicle production schedules. Our largest North American customers typically halt production for approximately 2 weeks in July and one week in December. Additionally, many of our customers in Europe typically shutdown vehicle production during portions of August and one week in December. 2. PLAN OF ARRANGEMENT On August 31, 2010, following approval by the Class A Subordinate Voting and Class B Shareholders of the Company, we completed the court-approved plan of arrangement (the ""Arrangement"") with the Stronach group whereby the Company's dual-class share structure was collapsed. The transaction also: (i) set a termination date and declining fee schedule for the consulting, business development and business services contracts Magna has in place with Frank Stronach and his affiliated entities; and (ii) established a partnership with the Stronach group to pursue opportunities in the vehicle electrification business. (a) Capital Transaction The Company purchased for cancellation all 726,829 outstanding Class B Shares, which were held indirectly by the Stronach group, for $300 million in cash and 9.0 million newly issued Class A Subordinate Voting Shares. The newly issued shares held indirectly by the Stronach group represented an equal equity ownership and voting interest of 7.4% as of August 31, 2010. The costs related to the Arrangement were $13 million. In addition, Magna's Articles were amended to remove the Class B Shares from the authorized capital and to make non-substantive consequential changes to its Articles, including renaming the Class A Subordinate Voting Shares as Common Shares and eliminating provisions which no longer apply due to the elimination of the Class B Shares. (b) Vehicle Electrification Partnership The partnership involves the engineering, development and integration of electric vehicles of any type, the development, testing and manufacturing of batteries and battery packs for hybrid (H) and electric vehicles (EV) and all ancillary activities in connection with electric vehicle technologies. Magna's original investment in the partnership included the assets of the Company's recently established E-Car Systems vehicle electrification and battery business unit, certain other vehicle electrification assets, and $145 million in cash. On August 31, 2010, the Stronach group invested $80 million in cash for a 27% equity interest in the partnership, reducing Magna's equity interest to 73%. The partnership is controlled by the Stronach group. The impact of the Arrangement on the consolidated balance sheet was as follows: Class A Stronach

RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES (a) For the nine months ended September 30, 2010 During the second quarter of 2010, the Company recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $21 million ($18 million after tax) in costs of goods sold and $3 million ($3 million after tax) in selling, general and administrative expense related to the planned closure of a powertrain systems facility and two body & chassis systems facilities in the United States. (b) For the nine months ended September 30, 2009 During the second quarter of 2009, after failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York, the Company decided to wind down these operations. Given the significance of the facility's cashflows in relation to the reporting unit, management determined that it was more likely than not that goodwill at its Powertrain North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired. Therefore, the Company recorded a $75 million goodwill impairment charge. The goodwill impairment charge was calculated by determining the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the Company had acquired the reporting unit as at June 30, 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company recorded restructuring costs of $6 million ($6 million after tax) in costs of goods sold related to the planned closure of this powertrain systems facility. 4.

The amendment reduced service costs and retirement medical benefit expense in 2009 and future years. As a result of amending the plan, a curtailment gain of $26 million was recorded in cost of goods sold in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009. 8.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- (i) The exercise price noted above represents the weighted average exercise price in Canadian dollars. (ii) On August 19, 2010, options to acquire 121,500 Common Shares were surrendered for cancellation in exchange for payment of the in-the- money value of such options on such date. The aggregate in-the-money value of the options surrendered was $4 million and was charged to contributed surplus (note 10). On August 12, 2009, following approval by the Company's Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee and in accordance with the Amended and Restated Incentive Stock Option Plan, the Company granted stock appreciation rights (""SARs"") to certain executives in respect of 191,700 previously granted and unexercised stock options. On August 14, 2009, 166,411 SARs were exercised and an equal number of previously granted and unexercised stock options were surrendered and cancelled. On exercise of the SARs, the executives received, in aggregate, cash of $1 million, representing an amount equal to the difference between the aggregate fair market value of the shares covered by the surrendered options and the aggregate exercise price of such surrendered options. The weighted average assumptions used in measuring the fair value of stock options granted and/or modified and the compensation expense recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses are as follows: Three months Nine months

 ----------------------------------------------------------------- During the three-month period ended September 30, 2010, following the resignation of two employees of the Company, option agreements with these employees were modified, which resulted in a one-time charge to compensation expense of $16 million. This charge represents the fair value of the options at the date of modification net of the originally measured compensation cost which has been reversed. Compensation expense recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2010 was $23 million (2009 - $1 million), and $33 million (2009 - $2 million), respectively. (b) Long-term retention program Information about the Company's long-term retention program is as follows (number of shares in table below are expressed in whole numbers): September 30,

CAPITAL STOCK (a) In accordance with the Arrangement, Magna's Articles were amended to remove the Class B Shares from the authorized capital and to make non-substantive consequential changes to its Articles, including renaming the Class A Subordinate Voting Shares as Common Shares and eliminating provisions which no longer apply due to the elimination of the Class B Shares.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------- (b) Fair value The Company determined the estimated fair values of its financial instruments based on valuation methodologies it believes are appropriate; however, considerable judgment is required to develop these estimates. Accordingly, these estimated fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The estimated fair value amounts can be materially affected by the use of different assumptions or methodologies. The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments are described below: Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, bank indebtedness, accounts payable, accrued salaries and wages, other accrued liabilities and income taxes payable. Due to the short period to maturity of the instruments, the carrying values as presented in the consolidated balance sheets are reasonable estimates of fair values. Investments At September 30, 2010, the Company held Canadian third party asset-backed commercial paper (""ABCP"") with a face value of Cdn$127 million (December 31, 2009 - Cdn$134 million). The carrying value and estimated fair value of this investment was Cdn$84 million (December 31, 2009 - Cdn$88 million). As fair value information is not readily determinable for the Company's investment in ABCP, the fair value was based on a valuation technique estimating the fair value from the perspective of a market participant. At September 30, 2010, the Company held an equity investment in a publicly traded Company. The carrying value and fair value of this investment was $16 million, which was based on the closing share price of the investment on September 30, 2010. Term debt The Company's term debt includes $14 million due within one year. Due to the short period to maturity of this debt, the carrying value as presented in the consolidated balance sheet is a reasonable estimate of its fair value. (c) Credit risk The Company's financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, long-term receivables, held to maturity investments, and foreign exchange forward contracts with positive fair values. The Company's held for trading investments include an investment in ABCP. Given the continuing uncertainties regarding the value of the underlying assets, the amount and timing over cash flows and the risk of collateral calls in the event that spreads widened considerably, the Company could be exposed to further losses on its investment. Cash and cash equivalents, which consists of short-term investments, are only invested in governments, bank term deposits and bank commercial paper with an investment grade credit rating. Credit risk is further reduced by limiting the amount which is invested in certain governments or any major financial institution. The Company is also exposed to credit risk from the potential default by any of its counterparties on its foreign exchange forward contracts. The Company mitigates this credit risk by dealing with counterparties who are major financial institutions that the Company anticipates will satisfy their obligations under the contracts. In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to credit risk from its customers, substantially all of which are in the automotive industry and are subject to credit risks associated with the automotive industry. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, sales to the Company's six largest customers represented 75% and 79% of the Company's total sales, respectively, and substantially all of our sales are to customers in which the Company has ongoing contractual relationships. (d) Currency risk The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates when manufacturing facilities have committed to the delivery of products for which the selling price has been quoted in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency, or when materials and equipment are purchased in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency. In an effort to manage this net foreign exchange exposure, the Company employs hedging programs, primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. As at September 30, 2010, the net foreign exchange exposure was not material. (e) Interest rate risk The Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk due to the short-term maturity of its monetary current assets and current liabilities. In particular, the amount of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents is impacted more by the investment decisions made and the demands to have available cash on hand, than by movements in the interest rates over a given period. In addition, the Company is not exposed to interest rate risk on its term debt instruments as the interest rates on these instruments are fixed. 14. SEGMENTED INFORMATION As a result of the completion of the Arrangement, the Company's E-Car business began to be managed as a separate operating group. Accordingly, the company's segmented reporting has been amended to reflect this change. Three months ended

We design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced automotive systems, assemblies, modules and components, and engineer and assemble complete vehicles, primarily for sale to original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"") of cars and light trucks. We capabilities include the design, engineering, testing and manufacture of automotive interior systems; seating systems; closure systems; body and chassis systems; vision systems; electronic systems; exterior systems; powertrain systems; roof systems; hybrid and electric vehicles/systems; as well as complete vehicle engineering and assembly. We follow a corporate policy of functional and operational decentralization, pursuant to which We conduct We operations through divisions, each of which is an autonomous business unit operating within pre-determined guidelines. As at September 30, 2010, We had 245 manufacturing operations and 80 product development, engineering and sales centres in 25 countries. HIGHLIGHTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- In the third quarter of 2010, North American light vehicle production increased 28% relative to the third quarter of 2009, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year increases. Third quarter 2010 light vehicle production in North America declined only 4% from the second quarter of 2010, a much less dramatic seasonal decline than is historically experienced. In Western Europe, light vehicle production declined approximately 1% from the third quarter of 2009, a quarter in which European vehicle sales and production were supported by vehicle ""scrappage"" programs in a number of European countries. However, 2010 Western European production has remained stronger than we anticipated. we total sales for the third quarter of 2010 increased 27% over the third quarter of 2009. As was the case in the second quarter of 2010, North American, European and Rest of World production sales, as well as complete vehicle assembly sales and tooling, engineering and other sales all exceeded third quarter of 2009 levels. Third quarter 2010 operating income increased $236 million to $317 million, compared to operating income of $81 million for the third quarter of 2009. Our continued strong operating results reflect, among other things: - improved light vehicle production in North America;
 - the ongoing benefit of Our efforts over the past few years to
 restructure and right-size Our operations, as well as to reduce costs
 across the organization;
 - the benefit of Our efforts to improve underperforming operations
 around the world;
 - the benefit of a commercial settlement with a customer related to the
 recovery of previously expensed engineering and design costs; and
 - an accounts receivable valuation allowance in the third quarter of
 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by a stock-based compensation charge as a result of modifying option agreements following the resignation of two employees. Stock Split Our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split, to be implemented by way of a stock dividend, whereby Our shareholders will receive an additional Common Share for each Common Share held. a stock dividend, whereby our shareholders will receive an additional Common Share for each Common Share held will be payable on November 24, 2010, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 16, 2010. All equity-based compensation plans or arrangements and our normal course issuer bid (discussed below) will be adjusted to reflect the issuance of additional Common Shares due to the declaration of Stock Split. Increase in Dividend Our Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend with respect to Our outstanding Common Shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2010. In light of ABOUT MAGNA's performance, Our Board of Directors Our Board of Directors decided to increase a stock dividend, whereby our shareholders will receive an additional Common Share for each Common Share held by 20% to U.S. $0.18 per share after giving effect to the two-for-one stock split referred to above (this equates to a dividend of U.S. $0.36 per share on a pre stock split basis). a dividend of U.S. is payable on December 15, 2010 to shareholders of record on November 30, 2010. Normal Course Issuer Bid Subject to approval by the Toronto Stock Exchange (""TSX"") and the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE""), Our Board of Directors Directors approved a normal course issuer bid to purchase up to 4.0 million of Our issued and outstanding Common Shares (adjusted to 8.0 million shares on a post stock split basis), representing approximately 3.3% of our outstanding Common Shares. The primary purposes of the normal course issuer bid are purchases for cancellation to offset potential dilution resulting from the exercise of stock options, and/or for purchases to fund our restricted stock unit program and Our obligations to Our deferred profit sharing plans. the normal course issuer bid is expected to commence on or about November 10, 2010 and will terminate one year later. All purchases of Common Shares will be made at the market price at the time of purchase in accordance with the rules and policies of the TSX. Purchases may also be made on the NYSE in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Plan of Arrangement On August 31, 2010, following approval by our Class A Subordinate Voting and Class B Shareholders, our completed the court-approved plan of arrangement (the ""Arrangement"") with the Stronach group whereby our dual-class share structure was collapsed. The transaction also: (i) set a termination date and declining fee schedule for the consulting, business development and business services contracts ABOUT MAGNA has in place with Stronach and Stronach affiliated entities; and (ii) established a partnership with the Stronach group Stronach to pursue opportunities in the vehicle electrification business. (a) Capital Transaction We purchased for cancellation all 726,829 outstanding Class B Shares, which were held indirectly by the Stronach groupStronach , for $300 million in cash and 9.0 million newly issued Class A Subordinate Voting Shares. The newly issued shares held indirectly by the Stronach group represented an equal equity ownership and voting interest of 7.4% as of August 31, 2010. Issue costs related to the issuance of The newly issued shares held indirectly by the Stronach group were $13 million. In addition, ABOUT MAGNA's Articles were amended to remove The newly issued shares held indirectly by the Stronach group from the authorized capital and to make non-substantive consequential changes to The newly issued shares held indirectly by the Stronach group Articles, including renaming the Class A Subordinate Voting Shares as Common Shares and eliminating provisions which no longer apply due to the elimination of The newly issued shares held indirectly by the Stronach group. (b) Vehicle Electrification Partnership (b) Vehicle Electrification Partnership involves the engineering, development and integration of electric vehicles of any type, the development, testing and manufacturing of batteries and battery packs for hybrid (H) and electric vehicles (EV) and all ancillary activities in connection with electric vehicle technologies. Our original investment in (b) Vehicle Electrification Partnership included the assets of Our recently established E-Car Systems vehicle electrification and battery business unit, certain other vehicle electrification assets, and $145 million in cash. On August 31, 2010, the Stronach group invested $80 million in cash for a 27% equity interest in (b) Vehicle Electrification Partnership, reducing our equity interest to 73%. (b) Vehicle Electrification Partnership is controlled by the Stronach group. Governance As previously announced, in connection with the elimination of our dual class structure effective August 31, 2010, our Chairman, Frank Stronach, has resigned as a member of the Nominating Committee of our Directors. This vacancy was filled today by Our Board of Directors's appointment of Louis Lataif, Dean Emeritus of Boston University School of Management and former President of Ford Europe. the Nominating Committee is now comprised entirely of independent directors and, consistent with the Nominating Committee mandate, will undertake a comprehensive review of Our Board of Directors's composition with a view to ensuring that Our Board of Directors Our Board of Directors continues to have the capabilities to oversee our operations globally. the Nominating Committee plans to retain an internationally recognized firm to assist in the Nominating Committee search for potential future Our Board of Directors members as part of this review process. FINANCIAL RESULTS SUMMARY ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the third quarter of 2010, our posted sales of $5.9 billion, an increase of 27% from the third quarter of 2009. This higher sales level was a result of increases in our North American, European and Rest of World production sales, complete vehicle assembly sales and tooling, engineering and other sales. Comparing the third quarter of 2010 to the third quarter of 2009: - North American vehicle production increased by 28% and average dollar
 content per vehicle increased 9%;
 - European vehicle production decreased 1% while average dollar content
 per vehicle increased 8%;
 - Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 21% to $519 million, as
 complete vehicle assembly volumes increased 41%;
 - Rest of World production sales increased 29% to $249 million from
 $193 million; and
 - Tooling, engineering and other sales increased 52% to $502 million
 from $330 million.
 During the third quarter of 2010, we generated operating income of $317 million compared to $81 million for the third quarter of 2009. The $236 million increase in operating income was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes in North America. In addition, operating income was positively impacted by: - the $33 million benefit of a commercial settlement with a customer
 related to the recovery of previously expensed engineering and design
 costs;
 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs;
 - a $16 million accounts receivable valuation allowance in the third
 quarter of 2009;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - lower warranty costs;
 - lower costs incurred related to launches or for programs that have
 not fully ramped up production.
 These factors were partially offset by: - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities, in
 particular at certain electronics, and exteriors and interiors
 systems facilities in Europe;
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - a $16 million stock-based compensation charge as a result of
 modifying option agreements following the resignation of two
 employees;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - a $9 million favourable revaluation of our investment in asset-backed
 commercial paper (""ABCP"") in the third quarter of 2009;
 - increased stock-based compensation; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the third quarter of
 2009.
 During the third quarter of 2010, net income increased $190 million to $241 million compared to $51 million for the third quarter of 2009. The increase in net income was a result of the increase in operating income partially offset by higher income taxes. During the third quarter of 2010, our diluted earnings per share increased by $1.61 to $2.06 compared to $0.45 for the third quarter of 2009. The increase in diluted earnings per share is as a result of the increase in net income partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the third quarter of 2010. The increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to the net issue of shares during the third quarter of 2010 related to the Arrangement and an increase in the number of diluted shares associated with stock options.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) Restructuring and Impairment Charges (a) For the nine months ended September 30, 2010 During the second quarter of 2010, we recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $21 million in cost of goods sold and $3 million in selling, general and administrative expense related to the planned closure of a powertrain systems facility and two body & chassis systems facilities in North America. (b) For the nine months ended September 30, 2009 During the second quarter of 2009, after failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York, we decided to wind down failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York. Given the significance of the facility's cashflows in relation to the reporting unit, we determined that it was more likely than not that goodwill at the Powertrain North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired. Therefore, we recorded a $75 million goodwill impairment charge. a $75 million goodwill impairment charge was calculated by determining the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if we had acquired the reporting unit as at June 30, 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, we recorded restructuring costs of $6 million related to the planned closure of a powertrain systems facility. (2) Curtailment gain During the second quarter of 2009, we amended we Retiree Premium Reimbursement Plan in Canada and the United States, such that most employees retiring on or after August 1, 2009 would no longer participate in the court-approved plan of arrangement (the ""Arrangement"") with the Stronach group whereby our dual-class share structure was collapsed. The amendment reduced service costs and retirement medical benefit expense in 2009 and future years. As a result of amending the court-approved plan of arrangement (the ""Arrangement"") with the Stronach group whereby our dual-class share structure was collapsed, a curtailment gain of $26 million was recorded in cost of goods sold in the second quarter of 2009. (3) Sale of Facility During the first quarter of 2010, we sold we interest in the Vehicle Electrification Joint Venture and realized a $14 million gain. INDUSTRY TRENDS AND RISKS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- we success is primarily dependent upon the levels of North American and European car and light truck production by we customers and the relative amount of content we have on the various programs. OEM production volumes in different regions may be impacted by factors which may vary from one region to the next, including but not limited to general economic and political conditions, interest rates, credit availability, energy and fuel prices, international conflicts, labour relations issues, regulatory requirements, trade agreements, infrastructure, legislative changes, and environmental emissions and safety issues. These factors and a number of other economic, industry and risk factors which also affect our success, including such things as relative currency values, commodities prices, price reduction pressures from our customers, the financial condition of our supply base and competition from manufacturers with operations in low cost countries, are discussed in our Annual Information Form and Annual Report on Form 40-F, each in respect of the year ended December 31, 2009, and remain substantially unchanged in respect of the third quarter ended September 30, 2010. In addition to the risk factors referenced above, our partnership with the Stronach group to pursue opportunities in the vehicle electrification business is subject to a number of additional risks. These additional risk factors are discussed in ABOUT MAGNA's Management Information Circular/Proxy Statement, dated May 31, 2010, under the heading ""Risks Relating to the Vehicle Electrification Joint Venture.""

 The preceding table reflects the average foreign exchange rates between the most common currencies in which we conduct business and our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The significant changes in these foreign exchange rates for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2010 impacted the reported U.S. dollar amounts of our sales, expenses and income. The results of operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates in the table above for the relevant period. Throughout this MD&A, reference is made to the impact of translation of foreign operations on reported U.S. dollar amounts where relevant. The results of operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar can also be affected by the impact of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency transactions (such as raw material purchases or sales denominated in foreign currencies). However, as a result of hedging programs employed by us, foreign currency transactions in the current period have not been fully impacted by movements in exchange rates. our record foreign currency transactions at the hedged rate where applicable. Finally, holding gains and losses on foreign currency denominated monetary items, which are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, impact reported results.

 External Production Sales - North America External production sales in North America increased 39% or $0.8 billion to $3.0 billion for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $2.2 billion for the third quarter of 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 28% increase in North American vehicle production volumes combined with a 9% increase in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 9% or $83 to $1,010 for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $927 for the third quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the third quarter
 of 2009, including the:
 - Jeep Grand Cherokee;
 - Ford Fiesta;
 - GMC Terrain; and
 - Cadillac SRX;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening of
 the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar; and
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave; and
 - Chevrolet Equinox.
 These factors were partially offset by: - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the Ford Escape, Mercury Mariner and
 Mazda Tribute;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the third
 quarter of 2009, including the Pontiac and Saturn brands; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the third quarter of
 2009.
 External Production Sales - Europe External production sales in Europe increased 7% or $0.10 billion to $1.65 billion for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $1.55 billion for the third quarter of 2009. This increase in production sales reflects an 8% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle partially offset by a 1% decrease in European vehicle production volumes. Our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 8% or $42 to $571 for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $529 for the third quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the third quarter
 of 2009, including the:
 - MINI Countryman;
 - Peugeot RCZ;
 - Porsche Cayenne and Volkswagen Touareg;
 - Audi A1;
 - Opel Astra; and
 - Mercedes-Benz SLS;
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - Volkswagen Tiguan;
 - Audi Q5;
 - BMW X1;
 - Porsche Panamera; and
 - Ford Transit; and
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to the third quarter of
 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by: - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the Ford Escape, Mercury Mariner and
 Mazda Tribute;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the third
 quarter of 2009, including the Pontiac and Saturn brands; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the third quarter of
 2009.
 External Production Sales - Rest of World External production sales in Rest of World increased 29% or $56 million to $249 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $193 million for the third quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - increased production and/or content on certain programs in China and
 Korea;
 - the acquisition of a Japanese roof systems facility in the first
 quarter of 2010;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the third quarter
 of 2009 in China; and
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales as a result of the
 strengthening of the Korean Won and Chinese Renminbi, each against
 the U.S. dollar.
 These factors were partially offset by the sale of our interest in an electronics systems joint venture in China in the first quarter of 2010. Complete Vehicle Assembly Sales The terms of our various vehicle assembly contracts differ with respect to the ownership of components and supplies related to the assembly process and the method of determining the selling price to the OEM customer. Under certain contracts our are acting as principal, and purchased components and systems in assembled vehicles are included in our inventory and cost of sales. These costs are reflected on a full-cost basis in the selling price of the final assembled vehicle to the OEM customer. Other contracts provide that third-party components and systems are held on consignment by us, and the selling price to the OEM customer reflects a value-added assembly fee only. Production levels of the various vehicles assembled by us have an impact on the level of us sales and profitability. In addition, the relative proportion of programs accounted for on a full-cost basis and programs accounted for on a value-added basis also impacts our level of sales and operating margin percentage, but may not necessarily affect our overall level of profitability. Assuming no change in total vehicles assembled, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a full-cost basis has the effect of increasing the level of total sales, however, because purchased components are included in cost of sales, profitability as a percentage of total sales is reduced. Conversely, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a value-added basis has the effect of reducing the level of total sales and increasing profitability as a percentage of total sales.

 Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 21% or $91 million to $519 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $428 million for the third quarter of 2009, while assembly volumes increased 41% or 5,990 units. The increase in complete vehicle assembly sales is primarily as a result of: - the launch of new assembly programs subsequent to the third quarter
 of 2009, including the:
 - MINI Countryman;
 - Peugeot RCZ; and
 - Aston Martin Rapide; and
 - an increase in assembly volumes for the Mercedes-Benz G-Class.
 These factors were partially offset by the end of production on certain assembly programs at our ABOUT MAGNA Steyr facility, including the: - BMW X3 in the third quarter of 2010;
 - Saab 9(3) Convertible in the fourth quarter of 2009; and
 - Chrysler 300 and Jeep Grand Cherokee in the second quarter of 2010.
 In addition, complete vehicle assembly sales were negatively impacted by a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. Tooling, Engineering and Other Tooling, engineering and other sales increased 52% or $172 million to $502 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $330 million for the third quarter of 2009. In the third quarter of 2010, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - MINI Cooper and Countryman;
 - Jeep Grand Cherokee;
 - BMW X3;
 - Mercedes-Benz M-Class;
 - Porsche Cayenne;
 - Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra; and
 - Chevrolet Volt.
 In the third quarter of 2009, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - Opel/Vauxhall Astra;
 - MINI Cooper and Countryman;
 - Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra;
 - BMW X3;
 - Ford F-Series;
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Opel Insignia;
 - Ford Freestar; and
 - Audi Q5.
 In addition, tooling, engineering and other sales decreased as a result of the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollarthe euro against the U.S. dollar. Gross Margin Gross margin increased $258 million to $810 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $552 million for the third quarter of 2009 and gross margin as a percentage of total sales increased to 13.6% for the third quarter of 2010 compared to 11.8% for the third quarter of 2009. The 1.8% increase in gross margin as a percentage of total sales was substantially due to increased gross margin earned as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes in North America. In addition, gross margin as a percentage of total sales was positively impacted by: - the $33 million benefit of a commercial settlement with a customer
 related to the recovery of previously expensed engineering and design
 costs;
 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - lower warranty costs; and
 - lower costs incurred related to launches or for programs that have
 not fully ramped up production.
 These factors were partially offset by: - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities, in
 particular at certain electronics, and exteriors and interiors
 systems facilities in Europe;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - increased commodity costs; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the third quarter of
 2009.
 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization costs decreased 13% or $25 million to $161 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $186 million for the third quarter of 2009. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily as a result of: - the impairment of certain assets subsequent to the third quarter of
 2009;
 - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar depreciation and amortization due
 to the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollarthe euro against the U.S. dollar; and
 - the disposition of certain facilities subsequent to the third quarter
 of 2009.
 Selling, General and Administrative (""SG&A"") SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 5.8% for the third quarter of 2010, compared to 6.1% for the third quarter of 2009. SG&A expense increased $56 million to $342 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $286 million for the third quarter of 2009. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily as a result of: - higher incentive compensation;
 - a $16 million stock-based compensation charge as a result of
 modifying option agreements following the resignation of two
 employees;
 - a $9 million favourable revaluation of our investment in ABCP in the
 third quarter of 2009;
 - higher costs to support the increased sales level; and
 - higher stock-based compensation.
 These factors were partially offset by: - a $16 million accounts receivable valuation allowance in the third
 quarter of 2009;
 - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar SG&A due to the weakening of the
 euro against the U.S. dollar;
 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs; and
 - the closure or disposition of certain facilities during or subsequent
 to the third quarter of 2009.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) EBIT is defined as income (loss) from operations before income taxes and minority interest as presented on our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements before net interest (income) expense. North America EBIT in North America increased $168 million to $276 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $108 million for the third quarter of 2009. The increase in EBIT was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - lower warranty costs;
 - a $3 million accounts receivable valuation allowance in the third
 quarter of 2009; and
 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs.
 These factors were partially offset by: - increased commodity costs;
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the third quarter of
 2009.
 Europe EBIT in Europe increased $58 million to $11 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $47 million for the third quarter of 2009 due to: - lower costs incurred related to launches or for programs that have
 not fully ramped up production;
 - a $13 million accounts receivable valuation allowance in the third
 quarter of 2009;
 - lower warranty costs; and
 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs.
 These factors were partially offset by: - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities, in
 particular at certain electronics, and exteriors and interiors
 systems facilities;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher management compensation; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the third quarter of
 2009.
 Rest of World Rest of World EBIT increased $1 million to $19 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $18 million for the third quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - additional margin earned on increased production sales; and
 - incremental margin earned on new programs that launched during or
 subsequent to the third quarter of 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the write-off of certain assets; and
 - the sale of our interest in an electronics systems joint venture in
 China in the first quarter of 2010.
 E-Car Systems E-Car Systems EBIT decreased $3 million to a loss of $16 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $13 million for the third quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of higher development and launch costs. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other EBIT increased $7 million to $24 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $17 million for the third quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - the $33 million benefit of a commercial settlement with a customer
 related to the recovery of previously expensed engineering and design
 costs;
 - an increase in affiliation fees earned from our divisions;
 - the positive impact of foreign exchange; and
 - an increase in equity income earned.
 These factors were partially offset by: - a $16 million stock-based compensation charge as a result of
 modifying option agreements following the resignation of two
 employees;
 - a $9 million favourable revaluation of our investment in ABCP in the
 third quarter of 2009;
 - higher incentive compensation; and
 - higher stock-based compensation.
 Interest (Income) Expense, net During the third quarter of 2010, we recorded net interest income of $3 million compared to $2 million of net interest expense for the third quarter of 2009. The $5 million increase in net interest income is as a result of a reduction in interest expense due to the repayment of our 7.08% Subordinated Debentures during the third quarter of 2009 and our 6.5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures subsequent to the third quarter of 2009. Operating Income Operating income increased $236 million to $317 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $81 million for the third quarter of 2009. The increase in operating income is the result of the increase in EBIT and the decrease in net interest expense, both as discussed above. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate on operating income (excluding equity income) decreased to 24.8% for the third quarter of 2010 compared to 38.5% for the third quarter of 2009. The effective income tax rate decreased primarily due to the utilization of losses that were previously not benefited, mainly in the United States. Minority Interest During the third quarter of 2010, we recorded $1 million of minority interest recovery with respect to the loss incurred in we E-Car systems partnership for the month of September. Net Income Net income increased $190 million to $241 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $51 million for the third quarter of 2009. The increase in net income is the result of the increase in operating income partially offset by higher income taxes, both as discussed above. Earnings per Share For the three

 Diluted earnings per share increased $1.61 to $2.06 for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $0.45 for the third quarter of 2009 as a result of the increase in net income, described above, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the third quarter of 2010. The increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to the net issue of shares during the third quarter of 2010 related to the Arrangement and an increase in the number of diluted shares associated with stock options.

 Cash flow from operations before changes in non-cash operating assets and liabilities increased $164 million to $422 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $258 million for the third quarter of 2009. The increase in cash flow from operations was due to a $190 million increase in net income, as discussed above, partially offset by a $26 million decrease in items not involving current cash flows. The decrease in items not involving current cash flows was primarily as a result of a $25 million decrease in depreciation and amortization and a $34 million decrease in other non-cash charges (including the previously discussed benefit of the commercial settlement) offset in part by the $40 million increase in future income taxes and non-cash portion of current taxes. Items not involving current cash flows are comprised of the following: For the three

 The increases in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable in the third quarter of 2010 was primarily due to the increase in production activities at the end of the third quarter of 2010 compared to the end of the second quarter of 2010 and new program launches. The increase in income taxes payable was primarily due to a higher income tax provision, resulting from increased earnings in excess of required instalment payments, as well as the receipt of income tax refunds.

In the third quarter of 2010, we invested $42 million in other assets related primarily to fully reimbursable tooling costs at we body & chassis systems operations and planning and engineering costs at powertrain systems operations for programs that will be launching subsequent to the third quarter of 2010. Purchase of subsidiaries During the third quarter of 2010, we invested $6 million to purchase subsidiaries. Proceeds from disposition Proceeds from disposition in the third quarter of 2010 were $52 million which included: a cash payment received on the sale of a long-term receivable related to fully reimbursable capitalized pre-production costs; and normal course fixed and other asset disposals.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Total capitalization increased by $0.52 billion to $8.06 billion at September 30, 2010 compared to $7.54 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase in capitalization was a result of a $493 million increase in shareholders' equity and an $84 million increase in minority interest partially offset by a $59 million decrease in liabilities. The increase in capitalization was primarily as a result of: - net income earned during the first nine months of 2010;
 - net unrealized gains on cash flow hedges, and the reclassification of
 net gains on cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive
 income to net income; and
 - an increase in contributed surplus related to stock-based
 compensation expense.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the repurchase of Class B Shares in connection with the Arrangement;
 and
 - dividends paid during the second and third quarters of 2010.
 The increase in minority interest was as a result of the formation of the E-Car partnership. The decrease in liabilities is primarily as a result of the repayment of debt in the second and third quarters of 2010 assumed on the acquisition of Cadence. Cash Resources During the first nine months of 2010, our cash resources increased by $0.3 billion to $1.7 billion primarily as a result of the cash provided from operating activities partially offset by cash used for investing activities and financing activities (including cash used for the Arrangement), as discussed above. In addition to our cash resources, our had term and operating lines of credit totalling $2.0 billion. The unused and available portion of our lines of credit was unchanged at $1.9 billion during the first nine months of 2010.

 related to the recovery of previously expensed engineering and design
 costs;
 - an increase in affiliation fees earned from our divisions;
 - the positive impact of foreign exchange; and
 - an increase in equity income earned.
 These factors were partially offset by: - increased incentive compensation; and
 - a $16 million stock-based compensation charge as a result of
 modifying option agreements following the resignation of two
 employees;
 - a $9 million favourable revaluation of our investment in asset-backed
 commercial paper in the third quarter of 2009; and

BASIS OF PRESENTATION The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Magna International Inc. and Magna International Inc. subsidiaries (collectively ""Magna"" or the ""Company"") have been prepared in United States dollars following Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") with respect to the preparation of interim financial information. Accordingly, The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Magna International Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively ""Magna"" or the ""Company"") do not include all the information and footnotes required in the preparation of annual financial statements and therefore should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2009 audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's 2009 Annual Report. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Magna International Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively ""Magna"" or the ""Company"") have been prepared using the same accounting policies as the December 31, 2009 annual consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Magna International Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively ""Magna"" or the ""Company"") reflect all adjustments, which consist only of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position at September 30, 2010 and the results of operations and cash flows for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 and 2009. Seasonality Our businesses are generally not seasonal. However, Our sales and profits are closely related to our automotive customers' vehicle production schedules. our automotive customers' typically halt production for approximately 2 weeks in July and one week in December. Additionally, many of our customers in Europe typically shutdown vehicle production during portions of August and one week in December. 2. PLAN OF ARRANGEMENT On August 31, 2010, following approval by the Class A Subordinate Voting and Class B Shareholders of the Company, our completed the court-approved plan of arrangement (the ""Arrangement"") with the Stronach group whereby the Company's dual-class share structure was collapsed. The transaction also: (i) set a termination date and declining fee schedule for the consulting, business development and business services contracts MAGNA INTERNATIONAL INC has in place with Stronach and Stronach affiliated entities; and (ii) established a partnership with the Stronach group Stronach to pursue opportunities in the vehicle electrification business. (a) Capital Transaction the Company purchased for cancellation all 726,829 outstanding Class B Shares, which were held indirectly by the Stronach groupStronach , for $300 million in cash and 9.0 million newly issued Class A Subordinate Voting Shares. the Class B Shares represented an equal equity ownership and voting interest of 7.4% as of August 31, 2010. The costs related to the Arrangement were $13 million. In addition, MAGNA INTERNATIONAL INC's Articles were amended to remove the Class B Shares from the authorized capital and to make non-substantive consequential changes to the Class B Shares Articles, including renaming the Class A Subordinate Voting Shares as Common Shares and eliminating provisions which no longer apply due to the elimination of the Class B Shares. (b) Vehicle Electrification Partnership (b) Vehicle Electrification Partnership involves the engineering, development and integration of electric vehicles of any type, the development, testing and manufacturing of batteries and battery packs for hybrid (H) and electric vehicles (EV) and all ancillary activities in connection with electric vehicle technologies. MAGNA INTERNATIONAL INC's original investment in (b) Vehicle Electrification Partnership included the assets of the Company's recently established E-Car Systems vehicle electrification and battery business unit, certain other vehicle electrification assets, and $145 million in cash. On August 31, 2010, the Stronach group invested $80 million in cash for a 27% equity interest in (b) Vehicle Electrification Partnership, reducing MAGNA INTERNATIONAL INC's equity interest to 73%. (b) Vehicle Electrification Partnership is controlled by the Stronach group. The impact of the Arrangement on the consolidated balance sheet was as follows: Class A Stronach

RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES (a) For the nine months ended September 30, 2010 During the second quarter of 2010, the Company recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $21 million ($18 million after tax) in costs of goods sold and $3 million ($3 million after tax) in selling, general and administrative expense related to the planned closure of a powertrain systems facility and two body & chassis systems facilities in United States. (b) For the nine months ended September 30, 2009 During the second quarter of 2009, after failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York, the Company the Company decided to wind down failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York. Given the significance of the facility's cashflows in relation to the reporting unit, management determined that it was more likely than not that goodwill at it Powertrain North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired. Therefore, the Company recorded a $75 million goodwill impairment charge. a $75 million goodwill impairment charge was calculated by determining the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the Company had acquired the reporting unit as at June 30, 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company the Company recorded restructuring costs of $6 million ($6 million after tax) in costs of goods sold related to the planned closure of a powertrain systems facility. 4.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- (i) The exercise price noted above represents the weighted average exercise price in Canadian dollars. (ii) On August 19, 2010, options to acquire 121,500 Common Shares were surrendered for cancellation in exchange for payment of the in-the- money value of such options on such date. The aggregate in-the-money value of the options surrendered was $4 million and was charged to contributed surplus (note 10). On August 12, 2009, following approval by the Company's Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee and in accordance with the Amended and Restated Incentive Stock Option Plan, the Company granted stock appreciation rights (""SARs"") to certain executives in respect of 191,700 previously granted and unexercised stock options. On August 14, 2009, 166,411 SARs were exercised and an equal number of previously granted and unexercised stock options were surrendered and cancelled. On exercise of 166,411 SARs, the executives received, in aggregate, cash of $1 million, representing an amount equal to the difference between the aggregate fair market value of the shares covered by the surrendered options and the aggregate exercise price of such surrendered options. The weighted average assumptions used in measuring the fair value of stock options granted and/or modified and the compensation expense recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses are as follows: Three months Nine months

 ----------------------------------------------------------------- During the three-month period ended September 30, 2010, following the resignation of two employees of the Company, option agreements with two employees of the Company were modified, which resulted in a one-time charge to compensation expense of $16 million. a one-time charge to compensation expense of $16 million represents the fair value of the options at the date of modification net of the originally measured compensation cost which has been reversed. Compensation expense recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2010 was $23 million (2009 - $1 million), and $33 million (2009 - $2 million), respectively.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------- (b) Fair value the Company determined the estimated fair values of the Company financial instruments based on valuation methodologies the Company believes are appropriate; however, considerable judgment is required to develop the estimated fair values of its financial instruments based on valuation methodologies it believes are appropriate. Accordingly, these estimated fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange can be materially affected by the use of different assumptions or methodologies. the use of different assumptions or methodologies used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments are described below: Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, bank indebtedness, accounts payable, accrued salaries and wages, other accrued liabilities and income taxes payable. Due to the short period to maturity of the instruments, the carrying values as presented in the consolidated balance sheets are reasonable estimates of fair values. Investments At September 30, 2010, the Company held Canadian third party asset-backed commercial paper (""ABCP"") with a face value of Cdn$127 million (December 31, 2009 - Cdn$134 million). The carrying value and estimated fair value of this investment was Cdn$84 million (December 31, 2009 - Cdn$88 million). As fair value information is not readily determinable for the Company's investment in ABCP, the fair value was based on a valuation technique estimating the fair value from the perspective of a market participant. At September 30, 2010, the Company held an equity investment in a publicly traded Company. The carrying value and fair value of an equity investment was $16 million, which was based on the closing share price of an equity investment on September 30, 2010. Term debt Term debt includes $14 million due within one year. Due to the short period to maturity of Term debt, the carrying value as presented in the consolidated balance sheet is a reasonable estimate of the Company fair value. (c) Credit risk the Company's financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, long-term receivables, held to maturity investments, and foreign exchange forward contracts with positive fair values. The Company's held for trading investments include an investment in ABCP. Given the continuing uncertainties regarding the value of the underlying assets, the amount and timing over cash flows and the risk of collateral calls in the event that spreads widened considerably, the Company could be exposed to further losses on the Company investment. Cash and cash equivalents, which consists of short-term investments, are only invested in governments, bank term deposits and bank commercial paper with an investment grade credit rating. Credit risk is further reduced by limiting the amount which is invested in certain governments or any major financial institution. the Company is also exposed to credit risk from the potential default by any of the Company counterparties on the Company foreign exchange forward contracts. the Company the Company mitigates this credit risk by dealing with counterparties who are major financial institutions that the Company the Company anticipates will satisfy counterparties who are major financial institutions that the Company anticipates obligations under the contracts. In the normal course of business, the Company the Company is exposed to credit risk from the Company customers, substantially all of which are in the automotive industry and are subject to credit risks associated with the automotive industry. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, sales to the Company's six largest customers represented 75% and 79% of the Company's total sales, respectively, and substantially all of Company sales are to customers in which the Company has ongoing contractual relationships. (d) Currency risk the Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates when manufacturing facilities have committed to the delivery of products for which the selling price has been quoted in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency, or when materials and equipment are purchased in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency. In an effort to manage this net foreign exchange exposure, the Company the Company employs hedging programs, primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. As at September 30, 2010, the net foreign exchange exposure was not material. (e) Interest rate risk the Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk due to the short-term maturity of the Company monetary current assets and current liabilities. In particular, the amount of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents is impacted more by the investment decisions made and the demands to have available cash on hand, than by movements in the interest rates over a given period. In addition, the Company is not exposed to interest rate risk on the Company term debt instruments as the interest rates on these instruments are fixed. 14. SEGMENTED INFORMATION As a result of the completion of the Arrangement, the Company's E-Car business began to be managed as a separate operating group. Accordingly, the Company's segmented reporting has been amended to reflect this change. Three months ended

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (a) Stock Split Our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split, to be implemented by way of a stock dividend, whereby shareholders of the Company will receive an additional Common Share for each Common Share held. a stock dividend, whereby shareholders of the Company will receive an additional Common Share for each Common Share held will be payable on November 24, 2010, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 16, 2010. All equity-based compensation plans or arrangements and our normal course issuer bid (discussed below) will be adjusted to reflect the issuance of additional Common Shares due to the declaration of the stock split. (b) Normal Course Issuer Bid Subject to approval by the Toronto Stock Exchange (""TSX"") and the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE""), the Company's Board of Directors approved a normal course issuer bid to purchase up to 4.0 million of the Company's Common Shares (adjusted to 8.0 million shares on a post stock split basis), representing approximately 3.3% of the Company's outstanding Common Shares. The primary purposes of the normal course issuer bid are purchases for cancellation to offset potential dilution resulting from the exercise of stock options, and/or for purchases to fund the Company's restricted stock unit program and Company obligations to Company deferred profit sharing plans. the normal course issuer bid is expected to commence on or about November 10, 2010 and will terminate one year later. All purchases of Common Shares will be made at the market price at the time of purchase in accordance with the rules and policies of the TSX.

St. Petersburg, together with we existing operations in Kaluga and Nizhny Novgorod, are just the beginning of we expansion strategy for Russia.”

Magna currently employs approximately 600 people in Russia and expects to double that number once the new facilities are fully operational.

A more detailed discussion of our consolidated financial results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2010 is contained in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Position and the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which are attached to this Press Release. DIVIDENDS --------- Our Board of Directors yesterday declared a quarterly dividend with respect to our outstanding Class A Subordinate Voting Shares and Class B Shares for the quarter ended June 30, 2010. The dividend of U.S. $0.30 per share is payable on September 15, 2010 to shareholders of record on August 31, 2010. The dividend increased from U.S. $0.18 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 given the continued profitability and better expectations for vehicle production in our key markets. 2010 OUTLOOK ------------ For the full year 2010, we expect our consolidated sales to be between $22 billion and $23 billion, based on full year 2010 light vehicle production volumes of approximately 11.5 million units in North America and approximately 12.0 million units in Europe. Full year 2010 average dollar content per vehicle is expected to be between $955 and $985 in North America and between $520 and $545 in Europe. We expect our full year 2010 complete vehicle assembly sales to be between $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion. In addition, we expect that full year 2010 spending for fixed assets will be in the range of $750 million to $800 million. This 2010 outlook assumes no significant acquisitions or divestitures. In addition, we have assumed that foreign exchange rates for the most common currencies in which we conduct business relative to our U.S. dollar reporting currency will approximate current rates.

We design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced automotive systems, assemblies, modules and components, and engineer and assemble complete vehicles, primarily for sale to original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"") of cars and light trucks. Our capabilities include the design, engineering, testing and manufacture of automotive interior systems; seating systems; closure systems; body and chassis systems; vision systems; electronic systems; exterior systems; powertrain systems; roof systems; hybrid and electric vehicles/systems; as well as complete vehicle engineering and assembly. We follow a corporate policy of functional and operational decentralization, pursuant to which we conduct our operations through divisions, each of which is an autonomous business unit operating within pre-determined guidelines. As at June 30, 2010, we had 242 manufacturing operations and 76 product development, engineering and sales centres in 25 countries. Our operations are segmented on a geographic basis between North America, Europe and Rest of World (primarily Asia, South America and Africa). A Co-Chief Executive Officer heads management in each of our two primary markets, North America and Europe. The role of the North American and European management teams is to manage our interests to ensure a coordinated effort across our different capabilities. In addition to maintaining key customer, supplier and government contacts in their respective markets, our regional management teams centrally manage key aspects of our operations while permitting our divisions enough flexibility through our decentralized structure to foster an entrepreneurial environment. HIGHLIGHTS ---------- In the second quarter of 2010, light vehicle production in North America and Western Europe improved relative to the second quarter of 2009, representing the third consecutive quarter of such year over year increases in both of our principal markets. In North America, light vehicle production increased 75% in the second quarter of 2010, as compared to the second quarter of 2009 when both General Motors and Chrysler were operating under bankruptcy protection. A sustained level of higher North American auto sales in 2010, as compared to the first half of 2009, as well as dealer inventory levels that remain below long-term historical averages have contributed to improved North American light vehicle production. In Western Europe, light vehicle production increased 13% over the second quarter of 2009. While we have been concerned about the potential negative impacts of vehicle sales ""pulled forward"" as a result of vehicle ""scrappage"" programs in place in Europe during 2009 and early 2010, as well as recent macroeconomic factors impacting certain European countries, vehicle sales in a number of European markets remained relatively strong in the second quarter of 2010, as have imports of European-built vehicles into North America. Our second quarter 2010 total sales increased 63% over the second quarter of 2009, with North American, European, and Rest of World production sales, as well as complete vehicle assembly sales and tooling, engineering and other sales all posting increases over the second quarter of 2009. Operating income increased $610 million to $373 million, compared to a loss of $237 million in the second quarter of 2009. Our strong second quarter results reflect, among other things: - the improved level of light vehicle production in North America and
 Western Europe;
 - the benefit of our efforts over the past few years to restructure,
 right-size and otherwise reduce costs across the organization;
 - lower costs incurred related to launches or for programs that have
 not fully ramped up production; and
 - the benefit of our efforts to improve underperforming operations
 around the world.
 Given the continued profitability and better expectations for vehicle production in our key markets, our Board of Directors increased our dividend to $0.30 per Class A Subordinate Voting or Class B Share in respect of the second quarter of 2010. We previously announced on May 6, 2010, that we had entered into a transaction agreement with the Stronach Trust pursuant to which holders of our Class A Subordinate Voting and Class B Shares were to be given the opportunity to decide whether to eliminate the dual class share capital structure. The required majorities of holders of our Class A Subordinate Voting and Class B Shares approved the proposed transaction at a special meeting of Magna's shareholders held on July 23, 2010. FINANCIAL RESULTS SUMMARY ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the second quarter of 2010, we posted sales of $6.1 billion, an increase of 63% from the second quarter of 2009. This higher sales level was a result of increases in our North American, European and Rest of World production sales, complete vehicle assembly sales and tooling, engineering and other sales. Comparing the second quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2009: - North American vehicle production increased by 75% and average dollar
 content per vehicle increased 27%;
 - European vehicle production increased 13% and average dollar content
 per vehicle increased 8%;
 - complete vehicle assembly sales increased 39% to $590 million from
 $423 million, as complete vehicle assembly volumes increased 59%;
 - Rest of World production sales increased 69% to $261 million
 from $154 million; and
 - tooling, engineering and other sales increased 22% to $411 million
 from $336 million.
 During the second quarter of 2010, we generated operating income of $373 million compared to an operating loss of $237 million for the second quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the second quarters of 2010 and 2009, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $579 million increase in operating income was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, operating income was positively impacted by: - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives undertaken during or subsequent to the second
 quarter of 2009;
 - favourable settlement of certain commercial items;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - lower costs incurred related to launches or for programs that have
 not fully ramped up production;
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence
 Innovation s.r.o, (""Cadence"");
 - the positive impact of foreign exchange;
 - recovery of receivables previously provided for; and
 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs. These factors were partially offset by: - higher incentive compensation;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - higher warranty costs;
 - higher development and launch costs in our vehicle electrification
 business; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009.
 During the second quarter of 2010, net income was $293 million compared to a net loss of $205 million for the second quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the second quarters of 2010 and 2009, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income for 2010 increased $458 million. The increase in net income was a result of the increase in operating income partially offset by higher income taxes. During the second quarter of 2010, our diluted earnings per share were $2.59 compared to diluted loss per share of $1.83 for the second quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the second quarters of 2010 and 2009, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, diluted earnings per share for 2010 increased $4.07. The increase in diluted earnings per share is as a result of the increase in net income, excluding unusual items, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the second quarter of 2010. The increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to an increase in the number of diluted shares associated with restricted stock and stock options since such shares were anti-dilutive in the second quarter of 2009. UNUSUAL ITEMS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the three months and six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, we recorded certain unusual items as follows: 2010 2009

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) Restructuring and Impairment Charges (a) For the six months ended June 30, 2010 During the second quarter of 2010, we recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $21 million in cost of goods sold and $3 million in selling, general and administrative expense related to the planned closure of a powertrain systems facility and two body & chassis systems facilities in North America. (b) For the six months ended June 30, 2009 During the second quarter of 2009, after failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York, we decided to wind down these operations. Given the significance of the facility's cashflows in relation to the reporting unit, we determined that it was more likely than not that goodwill at the Powertrain North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired. Therefore, we recorded a $75 million goodwill impairment charge. The goodwill impairment charge was calculated by determining the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if we had acquired the reporting unit as at June 30, 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, we recorded restructuring costs of $6 million related to the planned closure of this powertrain systems facility. (2) Curtailment gain During the second quarter of 2009, we amended our Retiree Premium Reimbursement Plan in Canada and the United States, such that most employees retiring on or after August 1, 2009 would no longer participate in the plan. The amendment reduced service costs and retirement medical benefit expense in 2009 and future years. As a result of amending the plan, a curtailment gain of $26 million was recorded in cost of goods sold in the second quarter of 2009. (3) Sale of Facility During the first quarter of 2010, we sold an electronics systems facility in China and realized a $14 million gain. INDUSTRY TRENDS AND RISKS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our success is primarily dependent upon the levels of North American and European car and light truck production by our customers and the relative amount of content we have on the various programs. OEM production volumes in different regions may be impacted by factors which may vary from one region to the next, including but not limited to general economic and political conditions, interest rates, credit availability, energy and fuel prices, international conflicts, labour relations issues, regulatory requirements, trade agreements, infrastructure, legislative changes, and environmental emissions and safety issues. These factors and a number of other economic, industry and risk factors which also affect our success, including such things as relative currency values, commodities prices, price reduction pressures from our customers, the financial condition of our supply base and competition from manufacturers with operations in low cost countries, are discussed in our Annual Information Form and Annual Report on Form 40-F, each in respect of the year ended December 31, 2009, and remain substantially unchanged in respect of the second quarter ended June 30, 2010.

 The preceding table reflects the average foreign exchange rates between the most common currencies in which we conduct business and our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The significant changes in these foreign exchange rates for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2010 impacted the reported U.S. dollar amounts of our sales, expenses and income. The results of operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates in the table above for the relevant period. Throughout this MD&A, reference is made to the impact of translation of foreign operations on reported U.S. dollar amounts where relevant. Our results can also be affected by the impact of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency transactions (such as raw material purchases or sales denominated in foreign currencies). However, as a result of hedging programs employed by us, foreign currency transactions in the current period have not been fully impacted by movements in exchange rates. We record foreign currency transactions at the hedged rate where applicable. Finally, holding gains and losses on foreign currency denominated monetary items, which are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, impact reported results.

 External Production Sales - North America External production sales in North America increased 123% or $1.66 billion to $3.02 billion for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $1.36 billion for the second quarter of 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 75% increase in North American vehicle production volumes combined with a 27% increase in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. Our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 27% or $207 to $975 for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $768 for the second quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - GM full-sized pickups and SUVs;
 - Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and Volkswagen
 Routan;
 - Jeep Wrangler;
 - Chrysler 300 and 300C and Dodge Charger;
 - Chevrolet Cobalt;
 - Dodge Journey;
 - Dodge Avenger and Chrysler Sebring;
 - Jeep Liberty and Dodge Nitro;
 - Dodge Ram; and
 - Jeep Patriot and Compass;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the second quarter
 of 2009, including the:
 - Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain;
 - Cadillac SRX; and
 - Ford Fiesta;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening
 of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar; and
 - the acquisition of several facilities from Meridian Automotive
 Systems Inc. (""Meridian"") in the second quarter of 2009. These factors were partially offset by: - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan and Lincoln MKZ;
 - Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX;
 - Ford Escape, Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute; and
 - Chevrolet Impala;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the second
 quarter of 2009, including the:
 - Saturn Vue, Sky and Aura; and
 - Pontiac Solstice, G5 and G6; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009.
 External Production Sales - Europe External production sales in Europe increased 23% or $331 million to $1.77 billion for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $1.44 billion for the second quarter of 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 13% increase in European vehicle production volumes combined with an 8% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. Our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 8% or $39 to $506 for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $467 for the second quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the second quarter
 of 2009, including the:
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Peugeot RCZ;
 - Mercedes-Benz SLS;
 - Skoda Yeti;
 - Opel Astra; and
 - Porsche Cayenne and Volkswagen Touareg;
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009, including Cadence; and
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - Mercedes-Benz C-Class;
 - Volkswagen Transporter;
 - BMW X1; and
 - Honda Civic. These factors were partially offset by: - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the
 euro and British pound, each against the U.S. dollar;
 - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - smart fortwo;
 - Volkswagen Caddy;
 - MINI Cabrio;
 - BMW X3; and
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the second
 quarter of 2009; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009.
 External Production Sales - Rest of World External production sales in Rest of World increased 69% or $107 million to $261 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $154 million for the second quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - increased production and/or content on certain programs in China,
 Korea, Brazil and South Africa;
 - an acquisition completed in the first quarter of 2010 in Japan;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the second quarter
 of 2009 in China and Japan; and
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales as a result of the
 strengthening of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar.
 Complete Vehicle Assembly Sales The terms of our various vehicle assembly contracts differ with respect to the ownership of components and supplies related to the assembly process and the method of determining the selling price to the OEM customer. Under certain contracts we are acting as principal, and purchased components and systems in assembled vehicles are included in our inventory and cost of sales. These costs are reflected on a full-cost basis in the selling price of the final assembled vehicle to the OEM customer. Other contracts provide that third-party components and systems are held on consignment by us, and the selling price to the OEM customer reflects a value-added assembly fee only. Production levels of the various vehicles assembled by us have an impact on the level of our sales and profitability. In addition, the relative proportion of programs accounted for on a full-cost basis and programs accounted for on a value-added basis also impacts our level of sales and operating margin percentage, but may not necessarily affect our overall level of profitability. Assuming no change in total vehicles assembled, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a full-cost basis has the effect of increasing the level of total sales, however, because purchased components are included in cost of sales, profitability as a percentage of total sales is reduced. Conversely, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a value-added basis has the effect of reducing the level of total sales and increasing profitability as a percentage of total sales.

 Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 39% or $167 million to $590 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $423 million for the second quarter of 2009, while assembly volumes increased 59% or 8,330 units. The increase in complete vehicle assembly sales is primarily as a result of: - the launch of new assembly programs subsequent to the second quarter
 of 2009, including the Peugeot RCZ and the Aston Martin Rapide; and
 - an increase in assembly volumes for the Mercedes-Benz G-Class and
 BMW X3. These factors were partially offset by: - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the
 euro against the U.S. dollar; and
 - the end of production of the Saab 9(3) Convertible in the fourth
 quarter of 2009.
 In addition, the Chrysler 300 and Jeep Grand Cherokee ended production in Europe during the second quarter of 2010. Tooling, Engineering and Other Tooling, engineering and other sales increased 22% or $75 million to $411 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $336 million for the second quarter of 2009. In the second quarter of 2010, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - Ford Fiesta;
 - MINI Cooper and Countryman;
 - BMW X3;
 - Peugeot RCZ;
 - Mercedes-Benz M-Class;
 - Jeep Grand Cherokee;
 - Chery A6;
 - Saab 9-5; and
 - Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra.
 In the second quarter of 2009, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - MINI Cooper, Clubman, Countryman;
 - Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra;
 - Buick LaCrosse;
 - Audi Q3;
 - Porsche 911;
 - Opel/Vauxhall Astra;
 - Dodge Journey;
 - BMW X3;
 - Volkswagen Golf;
 - Porsche Cayenne and Volkswagen Touareg; and
 - Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain.
 In addition, tooling, engineering and other sales decreased as a result of the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. Gross Margin Gross margin increased $561 million to $860 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $299 million for the second quarter of 2009 and gross margin as a percentage of total sales increased to 14.2% for the second quarter of 2010 compared to 8.1% for the second quarter of 2009. The unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section negatively impacted gross margin as a percentage of total sales in the second quarter of 2010 by 0.4% and positively impacted gross margin as a percentage of total sales in the second quarter of 2009 by 0.6%. Excluding these unusual items, the 7.1% increase in gross margin as a percentage of total sales was substantially due to increased gross margin earned as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, gross margin as a percentage of total sales was positively impacted by: - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives that were undertaken during or subsequent to the
 second quarter of 2009;
 - favourable settlement of certain commercial items;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs;
 - lower costs incurred related to launches or for programs that have
 not fully ramped up production; and
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009. These factors were partially offset by: - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - higher warranty costs;
 - higher development and launch costs in our vehicle electrification
 business; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009.
 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization costs decreased 9% or $17 million to $164 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $181 million for the second quarter of 2009. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily as a result of: - the impairment of certain assets subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009; and
 - the sale or disposition of certain facilities subsequent to the
 second quarter of 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by acquisitions completed during or subsequent to the second quarter of 2009. Selling, General and Administrative (""SG&A"") SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 5.5% for the second quarter of 2010, compared to 7.4% for the second quarter of 2009. SG&A expense increased $58 million to $333 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $275 million for the second quarter of 2009. Excluding the $3 million unusual item recorded in the second quarter of 2010 (as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section), SG&A expense increased by $55 million, primarily as a result of: - higher incentive compensation; and
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009. These factors were partially offset by: - lower restructuring and downsizing costs;
 - recovery of receivables previously provided for; and
 - the closure or disposition of certain facilities during or subsequent
 to the second quarter of 2009.
 Impairment Charges Impairment charges were $75 million for the second quarter of 2009 as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section. Earnings (loss) before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"")(1) For the three months ended June 30,

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) EBIT is defined as income (loss) from operations before income taxes as presented on our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements before net interest (income) expense. North America EBIT in North America increased $460 million to $261 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $199 million for the second quarter of 2009. Excluding the North American unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $429 million increase in EBIT was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives undertaken during or subsequent to the second
 quarter of 2009;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities; and
 lower restructuring and downsizing costs. These factors were partially offset by: - higher affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher development and launch costs in our vehicle electrification
 business; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009.
 Europe EBIT in Europe increased $115 million to $75 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $40 million for the second quarter of 2009 substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - favourable settlement of certain commercial items;
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence;
 - recovery of receivables previously provided for;
 - lower costs incurred related to launches or for programs that have
 not fully ramped up production; and
 - the closure of certain underperforming divisions subsequent to the
 second quarter of 2009. These factors were partially offset by: - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - higher net warranty costs;
 - higher development and launch costs in our vehicle electrification
 business;
 - higher affiliation fees paid to corporate; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009.
 Rest of World Rest of World EBIT increased $20 million to $28 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $8 million for the second quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - additional margin earned on increased production sales; and
 - incremental margin earned on new programs that launched during or
 subsequent to the second quarter of 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by higher launch costs incurred, primarily in Japan. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other EBIT increased $12 million to $9 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $3 million for the second quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - an increase in affiliation fees earned from our divisions;
 - the positive impact of foreign exchange; and
 - an increase in equity income earned. These factors were partially offset by: - increased incentive compensation; and
 - increased stock-based compensation.
 Interest Expense (Income), net During the second quarter of 2010, we did not record any net interest, compared to $3 million of net interest expense for the second quarter of 2009. The $3 million decrease in net interest is as a result of a reduction in interest expense due to the repayment of our 7.08% Subordinated Debentures and our 6.5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures subsequent to the second quarter of 2009. Operating Income (Loss) Operating income increased $610 million to $373 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $237 million for the second quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, operating income for the second quarter of 2010 increased $579 million. The increase in operating income is the result of the increase in EBIT and the decrease in net interest expense, both as discussed above. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate on operating income (excluding equity income) increased to 22.0% for the second quarter of 2010 compared to 13.6% for the second quarter of 2009. In the second quarters of 2010 and 2009, income tax rates were impacted by the unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section. Excluding unusual items, our effective income tax rate increased to 21.4% for the second quarter of 2010. Our expected statutory income tax rate for the second quarter of 2010 reflected more traditional rates as a result of our return to profitability in most jurisdictions. In addition, the effective income tax rate for the second quarter of 2010 was favourably impacted by the utilization of losses previously not benefited. Net Income (Loss) Net income increased $498 million to $293 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to a net loss of $205 million for the second quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income increased $458 million. The increase in net income is the result of the increase in operating income partially offset by higher income taxes, both as discussed above. Earnings (Loss) per Share For the

Excluding the unusual items, discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, diluted earnings per share increased $4.07 from the second quarter of 2009 as a result of the increase in net income (excluding unusual items) described above, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the quarter. The increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to an increase in the number of diluted shares associated with restricted stock and stock options since such shares were anti-dilutive in the second quarter of 2009.

 Cash flow from operations before changes in non-cash operating assets and liabilities increased $376 million to $463 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $87 million for the second quarter of 2009. The increase in cash flow from operations was due to a $498 million increase in net income, as discussed above, partially offset by a $122 million decrease in items not involving current cash flows. The decrease in items not involving current cash flows was primarily as a result of the $75 million goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of 2009 and a $17 million decrease in depreciation and amortization, offset in part by the $26 million curtailment gain in the second quarter of 2009. Items not involving current cash flows are comprised of the following: For the

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The increase in accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, accrued salaries and wages and other accrued liabilities in the second quarter of 2010 was primarily due to the increase in production activities compared to the first quarter of 2010. The increase in income taxes payable was primarily due to a higher tax provision resulting from increased earnings in excess of required instalment payments. Capital and Investment Spending For the

 Fixed and other assets additions In the second quarter of 2010, we invested $164 million in fixed assets. While investments were made to refurbish or replace assets consumed in the normal course of business and for productivity improvements, a large portion of the investment in the second quarter of 2010 was for manufacturing equipment for programs that will be launching subsequent to the second quarter of 2010. In the second quarter of 2010, we invested $23 million in other assets related primarily to fully reimbursable planning and engineering costs at our complete vehicle engineering and assembly operations and our roof systems operations for programs that will be launching subsequent to the second quarter of 2010. Purchase of subsidiaries During the second quarter of 2009, we invested $39 million to purchase subsidiaries, including: - Cadence, a manufacturer of exterior and interior systems primarily
 located in the Czech Republic; and
 - several facilities in the United States and Mexico from Meridian,
 which supply interior and exterior composites.
 Proceeds from disposition Proceeds from disposition in the second quarter of 2010 and 2009 were $28 million and $7 million, respectively, which represent normal course fixed and other asset disposals. Financing For the

 The increase in bank indebtedness during the second quarter of 2009 relates primarily to the draw down on our term and operating lines of credit in Europe that was required to fund current European operations. During the second quarter of 2010, we repaid $27 million of debt assumed on the acquisition of Cadence. After suspending payment of dividends during the second quarter of 2009, in May of 2010 our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.18 per Class A Subordinate Voting or Class B Share in respect of the first quarter of 2010. These dividends, which aggregated to $20 million, were paid in the second quarter of 2010. Financing Resources As at As at

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Total capitalization increased by $0.2 billion to $7.8 billion at June 30, 2010 compared to $7.5 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase in capitalization was a result of a $255 million increase in shareholders' equity partially offset by a $28 million decrease in liabilities. The increase in shareholders' equity was primarily as a result of net income earned during the first six months of 2010 partially offset by: - a $282 million decrease in accumulated net unrealized gains on
 translation of net investment in foreign operations, primarily as a
 result of the weakening of the euro, Canadian dollar and British
 pound, each against the U.S. dollar between December 31, 2009 and
 June 30, 2010; and
 - dividends paid during the second quarter of 2010.
 The decrease in liabilities is primarily as a result of a $27 million repayment of debt in the second quarter of 2010 assumed on the acquisition of Cadence. Cash Resources During the first six months of 2010, our cash resources increased by $0.4 billion to $1.7 billion primarily as a result of the cash provided from operating activities partially offset by cash used for investing activities, as discussed above. In addition to our cash resources, we had term and operating lines of credit totalling $2.0 billion. The unused and available portion of our lines of credit decreased $0.1 billion to $1.8 billion during the first six months of 2010.

 External Production Sales - North America External production sales in North America increased 97% or $2.84 billion to $5.77 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to $2.93 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 71% increase in North American vehicle production volumes combined with a 15% increase in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. Our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 15% or $126 to $964 for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to $838 for the six months ended June 30, 2009, primarily as a result of: - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and Volkswagen
 Routan;
 - GM full-sized SUVs and pickups;
 - Chevrolet Cobalt;
 - Dodge Journey;
 - Jeep Wrangler; and
 - Chrysler 300 and 300C and Dodge Charger;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening of
 the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar;

 ended June 30, 2009, including the:
 - Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain; and
 - Cadillac SRX; and
 - the acquisition of several facilities from Meridian in the second

 on certain programs, including the:
 - Ford Escape, Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute;
 - Ford F-Series; and
 - BMW X5;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the six months
 ended June 30, 2009, including the:
 - Pontiac G6, G5 and Solstice; and
 - Saturn Vue, Sky and Aura; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the six months ended
 June 30, 2009.
 External Production Sales - Europe External production sales in Europe increased 36% or $0.9 billion to $3.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to $2.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 22% increase in European vehicle production volumes combined with an 11% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. Our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 11% or $52 to $513 for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to $461 for the six months ended June 30, 2009, primarily as a result of: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the six months
 ended June 30, 2009, including the:
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Skoda Yeti;
 - Peugeot RCZ;
 - Mercedes-Benz SLS;
 - Opel Astra; and

 Korea, Brazil and South Africa;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the second quarter
 of 2009 in China and Japan;
 - an acquisition completed subsequent to the second quarter of 2009 in
 Japan; and

 ended June 30, 2009, including the Peugeot RCZ and the Aston Martin
 Rapide; and
 - an increase in assembly volumes for the Mercedes-Benz G-Class and BMW
 X3.
 These factors were partially offset by the end of production of the Saab 9(3) Convertible in the fourth quarter of 2009. In addition, the Chrysler 300 and Jeep Grand Cherokee ended production in Europe during the second quarter of 2010. Tooling, Engineering and Other Tooling, engineering and other sales increased 10% or $66 million to $744 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to $678 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009.

 North America EBIT in North America increased $803 million to $515 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to a loss of $288 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009. Excluding the North American unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $772 million increase in EBIT was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives undertaken during or subsequent to the six months
 ended June 30, 2009;
 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs; and
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities. These factors were partially offset by: - higher affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - higher development and launch costs in our vehicle electrification
 business; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the six months ended
 June 30, 2009.
 Europe EBIT in Europe increased $228 million to $69 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to a loss of $159 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009 substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - favourable settlement of certain commercial items;
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence;
 - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives undertaken during or subsequent to the six months
 ended June 30, 2009;
 - the sale or closure of certain underperforming divisions subsequent
 to the six months ended June 30, 2009; and
 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs;
 - recovery of receivables previously provided for;
 - lower costs incurred related to launches or for programs that have
 not fully ramped up production; and
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities. These factors were partially offset by: - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher warranty costs;
 - higher development and launch costs in our vehicle electrification
 business;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities;
 - higher affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - increased commodity costs; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009.
 Rest of World EBIT in Rest of World increased $50 million to $57 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to $7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009 primarily as a result: - additional margin earned on increased production sales; and
 - incremental margin earned on new programs that launched during or
 subsequent to the six months ended June 30, 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by higher launch costs incurred, primarily in Japan. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other EBIT increased $35 million to $14 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to a loss of $21 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009, primarily as a result of: - an increase in affiliation fees earned from our divisions; and
 - an increase in equity income earned.
 These factors were partially offset by: - increased incentive compensation; and
 - increased stock-based compensation. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- We previously announced on May 6, 2010, that we had entered into a transaction agreement with the Stronach Trust pursuant to which holders of our Class A Subordinate Voting shares were to be given the opportunity to decide whether to eliminate Magna's dual class share capital structure. The proposed transaction would also: (i) set a termination date and declining fee schedule for the consulting, business development and business services contracts we have in place with Frank Stronach and his affiliated entities; and (ii) establish a joint venture with the Stronach group to jointly continue to pursue opportunities in the vehicle electrification business. The required majorities of holders of our Class A Subordinate Voting and Class B shares approved the proposed transaction at a special meeting of our shareholders held on July 23, 2010. The proposed transaction remains subject to: (i) approval by the Ontario Superior Court at a hearing scheduled to be held on August 12 and 13, 2010; and (ii) the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The proposed transaction also remains subject to the risk factors set forth in Magna's Management Information Circular/Proxy Statement dated May 31, 2010, as amended and supplemented by the Supplement dated July 8, 2010, which risk factors are incorporated by reference. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- From time to time, we may be contingently liable for litigation and other claims. Refer to note 24 of our 2009 audited consolidated financial statements, which describes these claims. For a discussion of risk factors relating to legal and other claims against us, refer to page 35 of our Annual Information Form and Annual Report on Form 40-F, each in respect of the year ended December 31, 2009. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- The previous discussion contains statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of applicable securities legislation, including, but not limited to, statements relating to: automobile sales and light vehicle production volumes and the timing of new program launches. The forward-looking information in this document is presented for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward-looking statements may include financial and other projections, as well as statements regarding our future plans, objectives or economic performance, or the assumptions underlying any of the foregoing, and other statements that are not recitations of historical fact. We use words such as ""may"", ""would"", ""could"", ""should"", ""will"", ""likely"", ""expect"", ""anticipate"", ""believe"", ""intend"", ""plan"", ""forecast"", ""outlook"", ""project"", ""estimate"" and similar expressions suggesting future outcomes or events to identify forward-looking statements. Any such forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and are based on assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and our perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors we believe are appropriate in the circumstances. However, whether actual results and developments will conform with our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks, assumptions and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and the effects of which can be difficult to predict, including, without limitation: the potential for a slower than anticipated economic recovery or a deterioration of economic conditions; production volumes and sales levels which are below forecast levels; our dependence on outsourcing by our customers; the termination or non renewal by our customers of any material contracts; our ability to identify and successfully exploit shifts in technology; restructuring, downsizing and/or other significant non-recurring costs; impairment charges; our ability to successfully grow our sales to non-traditional customers; unfavourable product or customer mix; risks of conducting business in foreign countries, including China, India, Brazil, Russia and other developing markets; our ability to quickly shift our manufacturing footprint to take advantage of lower cost manufacturing opportunities; disruptions in the capital and credit markets; fluctuations in relative currency values; our ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions; pricing pressures, including our ability to offset price concessions demanded by our customers; warranty and recall costs; the financial condition and credit worthiness of some of our OEM customers, including the potential that such customers may not make, or may seek to delay or reduce, payments owed to us; the financial condition of some of our suppliers and the risk of their insolvency, bankruptcy or financial restructuring; the highly competitive nature of the automotive parts supply business; product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage; changes in our mix of earnings between jurisdictions with lower tax rates and those with higher tax rates, as well as our ability to fully benefit tax losses; other potential tax exposures; legal claims against us; work stoppages and labour relations disputes; changes in laws and governmental regulations; costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations; potential conflicts of interest involving our indirect controlling shareholder, the Stronach Trust; and other factors set out in our Annual Information Form filed with securities commissions in Canada and our annual report on Form 40-F filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and subsequent filings. In evaluating forward-looking statements, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements and readers should specifically consider the various factors which could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. Unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, we do not intend, nor do we undertake any obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent information, events, results or circumstances or otherwise.

NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
(All amounts in U.S. dollars and all tabular amounts in millions unless
otherwise noted) ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Magna International Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively ""Magna"" or the ""Company"") have been prepared in United States dollars following Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") with respect to the preparation of interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required in the preparation of annual financial statements and therefore should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2009 audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's 2009 Annual Report. These interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the same accounting policies as the December 31, 2009 annual consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which consist only of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position at June 30, 2010 and the results of operations and cash flows for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009. Seasonality Our businesses are generally not seasonal. However, our sales and profits are closely related to our automotive customers' vehicle production schedules. Our largest North American customers typically halt production for approximately 2 weeks in July and one week in December. Additionally, many of our customers in Europe typically shutdown vehicle production during portions of August and one week in December. 2. RESTRUCTURING AND impairment charges (a) For the six months ended June 30, 2010 During the second quarter of 2010, the Company recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $21 million ($18 million after tax) in costs of goods sold and $3 million ($3 million after tax) in selling, general and administrative expense related to the planned closure of a powertrain systems facility and two body & chassis systems facilities in the United States. (b) For the six months ended June 30, 2009 During the second quarter of 2009, after failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York, the Company decided to wind down these operations. Given the significance of the facility's cashflows in relation to the reporting unit, management determined that it was more likely than not that goodwill at its Powertrain North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired. Therefore, the Company recorded a $75 million goodwill impairment charge. The goodwill impairment charge was calculated by determining the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the Company had acquired the reporting unit as at June 30, 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company recorded restructuring costs of $6 million ($6 million after tax) in costs of goods sold related to the planned closure of this powertrain systems facility. 3.

The amendment reduced service costs and retirement medical benefit expense in 2009 and future years. As a result of amending the plan, a curtailment gain of $26 million was recorded in cost of goods sold in the three-month period ended June 30, 2009. 7.

Capital Disclosures The Company manages capital in order to ensure the Company has adequate borrowing capacity and financial structure to allow financial flexibility and to provide an adequate return to shareholders. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares, purchase shares for cancellation, or increase or decrease the amount of debt outstanding. The Company monitors capital using the ratio of debt to total capitalization. Debt includes bank indebtedness and long-term debt as shown in the consolidated balance sheets. Total capitalization includes debt and all components of shareholders' equity. The Company's capitalization and debt to total capitalization is as follows: June 30, December 31,

 ----------------------------------------------------------------- (b) Fair value The Company determined the estimated fair values of its financial instruments based on valuation methodologies it believes are appropriate; however, considerable judgment is required to develop these estimates. Accordingly, these estimated fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The estimated fair value amounts can be materially affected by the use of different assumptions or methodologies. The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments are described below: Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, bank indebtedness, accounts payable, accrued salaries and wages, other accrued liabilities and income taxes payable. Due to the short period to maturity of the instruments, the carrying values as presented in the consolidated balance sheets are reasonable estimates of fair values. Investments At June 30, 2010, the Company held Canadian third party asset- backed commercial paper (""ABCP"") with a face value of Cdn$127 million (December 31, 2009 - Cdn$134 million). The carrying value and estimated fair value of this investment was Cdn$84 million (December 31, 2009 - Cdn$88 million). As fair value information is not readily determinable for the Company's investment in ABCP, the fair value was based on a valuation technique estimating the fair value from the perspective of a market participant. Term debt The Company's term debt includes $11 million due within one year. Due to the short period to maturity of this debt, the carrying value as presented in the consolidated balance sheet is a reasonable estimate of its fair value. (c) Credit risk The Company's financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, held to maturity investments, and foreign exchange forward contracts with positive fair values. The Company's held for trading investments include an investment in ABCP. Given the continuing uncertainties regarding the value of the underlying assets, the amount and timing over cash flows and the risk of collateral calls in the event that spreads widened considerably, the Company could be exposed to further losses on its investment. Cash and cash equivalents, which consists of short-term investments, are only invested in governments, bank term deposits and bank commercial paper with an investment grade credit rating. Credit risk is further reduced by limiting the amount which is invested in certain governments or any major financial institution. The Company is also exposed to credit risk from the potential default by any of its counterparties on its foreign exchange forward contracts. The Company mitigates this credit risk by dealing with counterparties who are major financial institutions that the Company anticipates will satisfy their obligations under the contracts. In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to credit risk from its customers, substantially all of which are in the automotive industry and are subject to credit risks associated with the automotive industry. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, sales to the Company's six largest customers represented 80% and 81% of the Company's total sales, respectively, and substantially all of our sales are to customers in which the Company has ongoing contractual relationships. (d) Currency risk The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates when manufacturing facilities have committed to the delivery of products for which the selling price has been quoted in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency, or when materials and equipment are purchased in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency. In an effort to manage this net foreign exchange exposure, the Company employs hedging programs, primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. As at June 30, 2010, the net foreign exchange exposure was not material. (e) Interest rate risk The Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk due to the short-term maturity of its monetary current assets and current liabilities. In particular, the amount of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents is impacted more by the investment decisions made and the demands to have available cash on hand, than by movements in the interest rates over a given period. In addition, the Company is not exposed to interest rate risk on its term debt instruments as the interest rates on these instruments are fixed. 13. Segmented Information Three months ended

We design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced automotive systems, assemblies, modules and components, and engineer and assemble complete vehicles, primarily for sale to original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"") of cars and light trucks. We capabilities include the design, engineering, testing and manufacture of automotive interior systems; seating systems; closure systems; body and chassis systems; vision systems; electronic systems; exterior systems; powertrain systems; roof systems; hybrid and electric vehicles/systems; as well as complete vehicle engineering and assembly. We follow a corporate policy of functional and operational decentralization, pursuant to which We conduct We operations through divisions, each of which is an autonomous business unit operating within pre-determined guidelines. As at June 30, 2010, We had 242 manufacturing operations and 76 product development, engineering and sales centres in 25 countries. We operations are segmented on a geographic basis between North America, Europe and Rest of World (primarily Asia, South America and Africa). A Co-Chief Executive Officer heads management in each of our two primary markets, North America and Europe. The role of the North American and European management teams is to manage our interests to ensure a coordinated effort across our different capabilities. In addition to maintaining key customer, supplier and government contacts in supplier and government contacts respective markets, the North American and European management teams centrally manage key aspects of our operations while permitting our divisions enough flexibility through our decentralized structure to foster an entrepreneurial environment. HIGHLIGHTS ---------- In the second quarter of 2010, light vehicle production in North America and Western Europe improved relative to the second quarter of 2009, representing the third consecutive quarter of such year over year increases in both of our principal markets. In North America, light vehicle production increased 75% in the second quarter of 2010, as compared to the second quarter of 2009 when both General Motors and Chrysler were operating under bankruptcy protection. A sustained level of higher North American auto sales in 2010, as compared to the first half of 2009, as well as dealer inventory levels that remain below long-term historical averages have contributed to improved North American light vehicle production. In Western Europe, light vehicle production increased 13% over the second quarter of 2009. While we have been concerned about the potential negative impacts of vehicle sales ""pulled forward"" as a result of vehicle ""scrappage"" programs in place in Europe during 2009 and early 2010, as well as recent macroeconomic factors impacting certain European countries, vehicle sales in a number of European markets remained relatively strong in the second quarter of 2010, as have imports of European-built vehicles into North America. Our second quarter 2010 total sales increased 63% over the second quarter of 2009, with North American, European, and Rest of World production sales, as well as complete vehicle assembly sales and tooling, engineering and other sales all posting increases over the second quarter of 2009. Operating income increased $610 million to $373 million, compared to a loss of $237 million in the second quarter of 2009. Our strong second quarter results reflect, among other things: - the improved level of light vehicle production in North America and
 Western Europe;
 - the benefit of Our efforts over the past few years to restructure,
 right-size and otherwise reduce costs across the organization;
 - lower costs incurred related to launches or for programs that have
 not fully ramped up production; and
 - the benefit of Our efforts to improve underperforming operations
 around the world.
 Given the continued profitability and better expectations for vehicle production in Our key markets, Our Board of Directors increased Our dividend to $0.30 per Class A Subordinate Voting or Class B Share in respect of the second quarter of 2010. Our previously announced on May 6, 2010, that Our had entered into a transaction agreement with the Stronach Trust the Stronach Trust pursuant to which holders of Our Class A Subordinate Voting and Class B Shares were to be given the opportunity to decide whether to eliminate the dual class share capital structure. The required majorities of holders of Our Class A Subordinate Voting and Class B Shares approved the proposed transaction at a special meeting of ABOUT MAGNA's shareholders held on July 23, 2010. FINANCIAL RESULTS SUMMARY ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the second quarter of 2010, Our posted sales of $6.1 billion, an increase of 63% from the second quarter of 2009. This higher sales level was a result of increases in our North American, European and Rest of World production sales, complete vehicle assembly sales and tooling, engineering and other sales. Comparing the second quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2009: - North American vehicle production increased by 75% and average dollar
 content per vehicle increased 27%;
 - European vehicle production increased 13% and average dollar content
 per vehicle increased 8%;
 - complete vehicle assembly sales increased 39% to $590 million from
 $423 million, as complete vehicle assembly volumes increased 59%;
 - Rest of World production sales increased 69% to $261 million
 from $154 million; and
 - tooling, engineering and other sales increased 22% to $411 million
 from $336 million.
 During the second quarter of 2010, we generated operating income of $373 million compared to an operating loss of $237 million for the second quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the second quarters of 2010 and 2009, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $579 million increase in operating income was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, operating income was positively impacted by: - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives undertaken during or subsequent to the second
 quarter of 2009;
 - favourable settlement of certain commercial items;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - lower costs incurred related to launches or for programs that have
 not fully ramped up production;
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence
 Innovation s.r.o, (""Cadence"");
 - the positive impact of foreign exchange;
 - recovery of receivables previously provided for; and
 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs. These factors were partially offset by: - higher incentive compensation;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - higher warranty costs;
 - higher development and launch costs in our vehicle electrification
 business; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009.
 During the second quarter of 2010, net income was $293 million compared to a net loss of $205 million for the second quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the second quarters of 2010 and 2009, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income for 2010 increased $458 million. The increase in net income was a result of the increase in operating income partially offset by higher income taxes. During the second quarter of 2010, our diluted earnings per share were $2.59 compared to diluted loss per share of $1.83 for the second quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the second quarters of 2010 and 2009, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, diluted earnings per share for 2010 increased $4.07. The increase in diluted earnings per share is as a result of the increase in net income, excluding unusual items, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the second quarter of 2010. The increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to an increase in the number of diluted shares associated with restricted stock and stock options since such shares were anti-dilutive in the second quarter of 2009. UNUSUAL ITEMS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the three months and six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, we recorded certain unusual items as follows: 2010 2009

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) Restructuring and Impairment Charges (a) For the six months ended June 30, 2010 During the second quarter of 2010, we recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $21 million in cost of goods sold and $3 million in selling, general and administrative expense related to the planned closure of a powertrain systems facility and two body & chassis systems facilities in North America. (b) For the six months ended June 30, 2009 During the second quarter of 2009, after failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York, we decided to wind down Our operations. Given the significance of the facility's cashflows in relation to the reporting unit, we determined that it was more likely than not that goodwill at the North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired. Therefore, we recorded a $75 million goodwill impairment charge. a $75 million goodwill impairment charge was calculated by determining the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if we had acquired the reporting unit as at June 30, 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, we recorded restructuring costs of $6 million related to the planned closure of a powertrain systems facility. (2) Curtailment gain During the second quarter of 2009, we amended we Retiree Premium Reimbursement Plan in Canada and the United States, such that most employees retiring on or after August 1, 2009 would no longer participate in the plan. The amendment reduced service costs and retirement medical benefit expense in 2009 and future years. As a result of amending the plan, a curtailment gain of $26 million was recorded in cost of goods sold in the second quarter of 2009. (3) Sale of Facility During the first quarter of 2010, we sold an electronics systems facility in China and realized a $14 million gain. INDUSTRY TRENDS AND RISKS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- we success is primarily dependent upon the levels of North American and European car and light truck production by we customers and the relative amount of content we have on the various programs. OEM production volumes in different regions may be impacted by factors which may vary from one region to the next, including but not limited to general economic and political conditions, interest rates, credit availability, energy and fuel prices, international conflicts, labour relations issues, regulatory requirements, trade agreements, infrastructure, legislative changes, and environmental emissions and safety issues. These factors and a number of other economic, industry and risk factors which also affect our success, including such things as relative currency values, commodities prices, price reduction pressures from our customers, the financial condition of our supply base and competition from manufacturers with operations in low cost countries, are discussed in our Annual Information Form and Annual Report on Form 40-F, each in respect of the year ended December 31, 2009, and remain substantially unchanged in respect of the second quarter ended June 30, 2010.

 The preceding table reflects the average foreign exchange rates between the most common currencies in which we conduct business and our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The significant changes in these foreign exchange rates for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2010 impacted the reported U.S. dollar amounts of our sales, expenses and income. The results of operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates in the table above for the relevant period. Throughout this MD&A, reference is made to the impact of translation of foreign operations on reported U.S. dollar amounts where relevant. The results of operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar can also be affected by the impact of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency transactions (such as raw material purchases or sales denominated in foreign currencies). However, as a result of hedging programs employed by us, foreign currency transactions in the current period have not been fully impacted by movements in exchange rates. our record foreign currency transactions at the hedged rate where applicable. Finally, holding gains and losses on foreign currency denominated monetary items, which are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, impact reported results.

 External Production Sales - North America External production sales in North America increased 123% or $1.66 billion to $3.02 billion for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $1.36 billion for the second quarter of 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 75% increase in North American vehicle production volumes combined with a 27% increase in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 27% or $207 to $975 for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $768 for the second quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - GM full-sized pickups and SUVs;
 - Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and Volkswagen
 Routan;
 - Jeep Wrangler;
 - Chrysler 300 and 300C and Dodge Charger;
 - Chevrolet Cobalt;
 - Dodge Journey;
 - Dodge Avenger and Chrysler Sebring;
 - Jeep Liberty and Dodge Nitro;
 - Dodge Ram; and
 - Jeep Patriot and Compass;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the second quarter
 of 2009, including the:
 - Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain;
 - Cadillac SRX; and
 - Ford Fiesta;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening
 of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar; and
 - the acquisition of several facilities from Meridian Automotive
 Systems Inc. (""Meridian"") in the second quarter of 2009. These factors were partially offset by: - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan and Lincoln MKZ;
 - Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX;
 - Ford Escape, Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute; and
 - Chevrolet Impala;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the second
 quarter of 2009, including the:
 - Saturn Vue, Sky and Aura; and
 - Pontiac Solstice, G5 and G6; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009.
 External Production Sales - Europe External production sales in Europe increased 23% or $331 million to $1.77 billion for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $1.44 billion for the second quarter of 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 13% increase in European vehicle production volumes combined with an 8% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 8% or $39 to $506 for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $467 for the second quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the second quarter
 of 2009, including the:
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Peugeot RCZ;
 - Mercedes-Benz SLS;
 - Skoda Yeti;
 - Opel Astra; and
 - Porsche Cayenne and Volkswagen Touareg;
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009, including Cadence; and
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - Mercedes-Benz C-Class;
 - Volkswagen Transporter;
 - BMW X1; and
 - Honda Civic. These factors were partially offset by: - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the
 euro and British pound, each against the U.S. dollar;
 - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - smart fortwo;
 - Volkswagen Caddy;
 - MINI Cabrio;
 - BMW X3; and
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the second
 quarter of 2009; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009.
 External Production Sales - Rest of World External production sales in Rest of World increased 69% or $107 million to $261 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $154 million for the second quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - increased production and/or content on certain programs in China,
 Korea, Brazil and South Africa;
 - an acquisition completed in the first quarter of 2010 in Japan;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the second quarter
 of 2009 in China and Japan; and
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales as a result of the
 strengthening of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar.
 Complete Vehicle Assembly Sales The terms of our various vehicle assembly contracts differ with respect to the ownership of components and supplies related to the assembly process and the method of determining the selling price to the OEM customer. Under certain contracts our are acting as principal, and purchased components and systems in assembled vehicles are included in our inventory and cost of sales. These costs are reflected on a full-cost basis in the selling price of the final assembled vehicle to the OEM customer. Other contracts provide that third-party components and systems are held on consignment by us, and the selling price to the OEM customer reflects a value-added assembly fee only. Production levels of the various vehicles assembled by us have an impact on the level of us sales and profitability. In addition, the relative proportion of programs accounted for on a full-cost basis and programs accounted for on a value-added basis also impacts our level of sales and operating margin percentage, but may not necessarily affect our overall level of profitability. Assuming no change in total vehicles assembled, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a full-cost basis has the effect of increasing the level of total sales, however, because purchased components are included in cost of sales, profitability as a percentage of total sales is reduced. Conversely, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a value-added basis has the effect of reducing the level of total sales and increasing profitability as a percentage of total sales.

 Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 39% or $167 million to $590 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $423 million for the second quarter of 2009, while assembly volumes increased 59% or 8,330 units. The increase in complete vehicle assembly sales is primarily as a result of: - the launch of new assembly programs subsequent to the second quarter
 of 2009, including the Peugeot RCZ and the Aston Martin Rapide; and
 - an increase in assembly volumes for the Mercedes-Benz G-Class and
 BMW X3. These factors were partially offset by: - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the
 euro against the U.S. dollar; and
 - the end of production of the Saab 9(3) Convertible in the fourth
 quarter of 2009.
 In addition, the Chrysler 300 and Jeep Grand Cherokee ended production in Europe during the second quarter of 2010. Tooling, Engineering and Other Tooling, engineering and other sales increased 22% or $75 million to $411 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $336 million for the second quarter of 2009. In the second quarter of 2010, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - Ford Fiesta;
 - MINI Cooper and Countryman;
 - BMW X3;
 - Peugeot RCZ;
 - Mercedes-Benz M-Class;
 - Jeep Grand Cherokee;
 - Chery A6;
 - Saab 9-5; and
 - Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra.
 In the second quarter of 2009, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - MINI Cooper, Clubman, Countryman;
 - Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra;
 - Buick LaCrosse;
 - Audi Q3;
 - Porsche 911;
 - Opel/Vauxhall Astra;
 - Dodge Journey;
 - BMW X3;
 - Volkswagen Golf;
 - Porsche Cayenne and Volkswagen Touareg; and
 - Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain.
 In addition, tooling, engineering and other sales decreased as a result of the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. Gross Margin Gross margin increased $561 million to $860 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $299 million for the second quarter of 2009 and gross margin as a percentage of total sales increased to 14.2% for the second quarter of 2010 compared to 8.1% for the second quarter of 2009. The unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section negatively impacted gross margin as a percentage of total sales in the second quarter of 2010 by 0.4% and positively impacted gross margin as a percentage of total sales in the second quarter of 2009 by 0.6%. Excluding these unusual items, the 7.1% increase in gross margin as a percentage of total sales was substantially due to increased gross margin earned as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, gross margin as a percentage of total sales was positively impacted by: - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives that were undertaken during or subsequent to the
 second quarter of 2009;
 - favourable settlement of certain commercial items;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs;
 - lower costs incurred related to launches or for programs that have
 not fully ramped up production; and
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009. These factors were partially offset by: - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - higher warranty costs;
 - higher development and launch costs in our vehicle electrification
 business; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009.
 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization costs decreased 9% or $17 million to $164 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $181 million for the second quarter of 2009. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily as a result of: - the impairment of certain assets subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009; and
 - the sale or disposition of certain facilities subsequent to the
 second quarter of 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by acquisitions completed during or subsequent to the second quarter of 2009. Selling, General and Administrative (""SG&A"") SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 5.5% for the second quarter of 2010, compared to 7.4% for the second quarter of 2009. SG&A expense increased $58 million to $333 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $275 million for the second quarter of 2009. Excluding the $3 million unusual item recorded in the second quarter of 2010 (as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section), SG&A expense increased by $55 million, primarily as a result of: - higher incentive compensation; and
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009. These factors were partially offset by: - lower restructuring and downsizing costs;
 - recovery of receivables previously provided for; and
 - the closure or disposition of certain facilities during or subsequent
 to the second quarter of 2009.
 Impairment Charges Impairment charges were $75 million for the second quarter of 2009 as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section. Earnings (loss) before Interest and Taxes (""EBIT"")(1) For the three months ended June 30,

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) EBIT is defined as income (loss) from operations before income taxes as presented on our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements before net interest (income) expense. North America EBIT in North America increased $460 million to $261 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $199 million for the second quarter of 2009. Excluding the North American unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $429 million increase in EBIT was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives undertaken during or subsequent to the second
 quarter of 2009;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities; and
 lower restructuring and downsizing costs. These factors were partially offset by: - higher affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher development and launch costs in our vehicle electrification
 business; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009.
 Europe EBIT in Europe increased $115 million to $75 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $40 million for the second quarter of 2009 substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - favourable settlement of certain commercial items;
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence;
 - recovery of receivables previously provided for;
 - lower costs incurred related to launches or for programs that have
 not fully ramped up production; and
 - the closure of certain underperforming divisions subsequent to the
 second quarter of 2009. These factors were partially offset by: - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - higher net warranty costs;
 - higher development and launch costs in our vehicle electrification
 business;
 - higher affiliation fees paid to corporate; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009.
 Rest of World Rest of World EBIT increased $20 million to $28 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $8 million for the second quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - additional margin earned on increased production sales; and
 - incremental margin earned on new programs that launched during or
 subsequent to the second quarter of 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by higher launch costs incurred, primarily in Japan. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other EBIT increased $12 million to $9 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $3 million for the second quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: - an increase in affiliation fees earned from our divisions;
 - the positive impact of foreign exchange; and
 - an increase in equity income earned. These factors were partially offset by: - increased incentive compensation; and
 - increased stock-based compensation.
 Interest Expense (Income), net During the second quarter of 2010, we did not record any net interest, compared to $3 million of net interest expense for the second quarter of 2009. The $3 million decrease in net interest is as a result of a reduction in interest expense due to the repayment of we 7.08% Subordinated Debentures and we 6.5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures subsequent to the second quarter of 2009. Operating Income (Loss) Operating income increased $610 million to $373 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $237 million for the second quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, operating income for the second quarter of 2010 increased $579 million. The increase in operating income is the result of the increase in EBIT and the decrease in net interest expense, both as discussed above. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate on operating income (excluding equity income) increased to 22.0% for the second quarter of 2010 compared to 13.6% for the second quarter of 2009. In the second quarters of 2010 and 2009, income tax rates were impacted by the unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section. Excluding unusual items, our effective income tax rate increased to 21.4% for the second quarter of 2010. Our expected statutory income tax rate for the second quarter of 2010 reflected more traditional rates as a result of our return to profitability in most jurisdictions. In addition, the effective income tax rate for the second quarter of 2010 was favourably impacted by the utilization of losses previously not benefited. Net Income (Loss) Net income increased $498 million to $293 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to a net loss of $205 million for the second quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income increased $458 million. The increase in net income is the result of the increase in operating income partially offset by higher income taxes, both as discussed above. Earnings (Loss) per Share For the

 Diluted earnings per share increased $4.42 to $2.59 for the second quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $1.83 for the second quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items, discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, diluted earnings per share increased $4.07 from the second quarter of 2009 as a result of the increase in net income (excluding unusual items) described above, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the quarter. The increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to an increase in the number of diluted shares associated with restricted stock and stock options since such shares were anti-dilutive in the second quarter of 2009.

 Cash flow from operations before changes in non-cash operating assets and liabilities increased $376 million to $463 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $87 million for the second quarter of 2009. The increase in cash flow from operations was due to a $498 million increase in net income, as discussed above, partially offset by a $122 million decrease in items not involving current cash flows. The decrease in items not involving current cash flows was primarily as a result of the $75 million goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of 2009 and a $17 million decrease in depreciation and amortization, offset in part by the $26 million curtailment gain in the second quarter of 2009. Items not involving current cash flows are comprised of the following: For the

 Fixed and other assets additions In the second quarter of 2010, we invested $164 million in fixed assets. While investments were made to refurbish or replace assets consumed in the normal course of business and for productivity improvements, a large portion of the investment in the second quarter of 2010 was for manufacturing equipment for programs that will be launching subsequent to the second quarter of 2010. In the second quarter of 2010, we invested $23 million in other assets related primarily to fully reimbursable planning and engineering costs at we complete vehicle engineering and assembly operations and we roof systems operations for programs that will be launching subsequent to the second quarter of 2010. Purchase of subsidiaries During the second quarter of 2009, we invested $39 million to purchase subsidiaries, including: - Cadence, a manufacturer of exterior and interior systems primarily
 located in the Czech Republic; and
 - several facilities in the United States and Mexico from Meridian,
 which supply interior and exterior composites.
 Proceeds from disposition Proceeds from disposition in the second quarter of 2010 and 2009 were $28 million and $7 million, respectively, which represent normal course fixed and other asset disposals. Financing For the

 The increase in bank indebtedness during the second quarter of 2009 relates primarily to the draw down on we term and operating lines of credit in Europe that was required to fund current European operations. During the second quarter of 2010, we repaid $27 million of debt assumed on the acquisition of Cadence. After suspending payment of dividends during the second quarter of 2009, in May of 2010 our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.18 per Class A Subordinate Voting or Class B Share in respect of the first quarter of 2010. These dividends, which aggregated to $20 million, were paid in the second quarter of 2010. Financing Resources As at As at

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Total capitalization increased by $0.2 billion to $7.8 billion at June 30, 2010 compared to $7.5 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase in capitalization was a result of a $255 million increase in shareholders' equity partially offset by a $28 million decrease in liabilities. The increase in capitalization was primarily as a result of net income earned during the first six months of 2010 partially offset by: - a $282 million decrease in accumulated net unrealized gains on
 translation of net investment in foreign operations, primarily as a
 result of the weakening of the euro, Canadian dollar and British
 pound, each against the U.S. dollar between December 31, 2009 and
 June 30, 2010; and
 - dividends paid during the second quarter of 2010.
 The decrease in liabilities is primarily as a result of a $27 million repayment of debt in the second quarter of 2010 assumed on the acquisition of CadenceCadence. Cash Resources During the first six months of 2010, our cash resources increased by $0.4 billion to $1.7 billion primarily as a result of the cash provided from operating activities partially offset by cash used for investing activities, as discussed above. In addition to our cash resources, our had term and operating lines of credit totalling $2.0 billion. The unused and available portion of our lines of credit decreased $0.1 billion to $1.8 billion during the first six months of 2010.

 External Production Sales - North America External production sales in North America increased 97% or $2.84 billion to $5.77 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to $2.93 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 71% increase in North American vehicle production volumes combined with a 15% increase in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 15% or $126 to $964 for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to $838 for the six months ended June 30, 2009June 30, 2009, primarily as a result of: - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and Volkswagen
 Routan;
 - GM full-sized SUVs and pickups;
 - Chevrolet Cobalt;
 - Dodge Journey;
 - Jeep Wrangler; and
 - Chrysler 300 and 300C and Dodge Charger;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening of
 the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the six months
 ended June 30, 2009, including the:
 - Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain; and
 - Cadillac SRX; and
 - the acquisition of several facilities from Meridian in the second
 quarter of 2009. These factors were partially offset by: - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - Ford Escape, Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute;
 - Ford F-Series; and
 - BMW X5;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the six months

 - Skoda Yeti;
 - Peugeot RCZ;
 - Mercedes-Benz SLS;
 - Opel Astra; and

Excluding the North American unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $772 million increase in EBIT was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives undertaken during or subsequent to the six months
 ended June 30, 2009;
 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs; and
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities. These factors were partially offset by: - higher affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - higher development and launch costs in our vehicle electrification
 business; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the six months ended
 June 30, 2009.

 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence;
 - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives undertaken during or subsequent to the six months

 - lower restructuring and downsizing costs;
 - recovery of receivables previously provided for;
 - lower costs incurred related to launches or for programs that have
 not fully ramped up production; and
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities. These factors were partially offset by: - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher warranty costs;
 - higher development and launch costs in our vehicle electrification
 business;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities;
 - higher affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - increased commodity costs; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the second quarter of
 2009.

NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
(All amounts in U.S. dollars and all tabular amounts in millions unless
otherwise noted) ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Magna International Inc. and Magna International Inc. subsidiaries (collectively ""Magna"" or the ""Company"") have been prepared in United States dollars following Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") with respect to the preparation of interim financial information. Accordingly, The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Magna International Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively ""Magna"" or the ""Company"") do not include all the information and footnotes required in the preparation of annual financial statements and therefore should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2009 audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's 2009 Annual Report. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Magna International Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively ""Magna"" or the ""Company"") have been prepared using the same accounting policies as the December 31, 2009 annual consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Magna International Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively ""Magna"" or the ""Company"") reflect all adjustments, which consist only of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position at June 30, 2010 and the results of operations and cash flows for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009. Seasonality Our businesses are generally not seasonal. However, Our sales and profits are closely related to our automotive customers' vehicle production schedules. our automotive customers' typically halt production for approximately 2 weeks in July and one week in December. Additionally, many of our customers in Europe typically shutdown vehicle production during portions of August and one week in December. 2. RESTRUCTURING AND impairment charges (a) For the six months ended June 30, 2010 During the second quarter of 2010, the Company recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $21 million ($18 million after tax) in costs of goods sold and $3 million ($3 million after tax) in selling, general and administrative expense related to the planned closure of a powertrain systems facility and two body & chassis systems facilities in United States. (b) For the six months ended June 30, 2009 During the second quarter of 2009, after failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York, the Company the Company decided to wind down failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York. Given the significance of the facility's cashflows in relation to the reporting unit, management determined that it was more likely than not that goodwill at it Powertrain North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired. Therefore, the Company recorded a $75 million goodwill impairment charge. a $75 million goodwill impairment charge was calculated by determining the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the Company had acquired the reporting unit as at June 30, 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company the Company recorded restructuring costs of $6 million ($6 million after tax) in costs of goods sold related to the planned closure of a powertrain systems facility. 3.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------- (b) Fair value the Company determined the estimated fair values of the Company financial instruments based on valuation methodologies the Company believes are appropriate; however, considerable judgment is required to develop the estimated fair values of its financial instruments based on valuation methodologies it believes are appropriate. Accordingly, these estimated fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange can be materially affected by the use of different assumptions or methodologies. the use of different assumptions or methodologies used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments are described below: Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, bank indebtedness, accounts payable, accrued salaries and wages, other accrued liabilities and income taxes payable. Due to the short period to maturity of the instruments, the carrying values as presented in the consolidated balance sheets are reasonable estimates of fair values. Investments At June 30, 2010, the Company held Canadian third party asset- backed commercial paper (""ABCP"") with a face value of Cdn$127 million (December 31, 2009 - Cdn$134 million). The carrying value and estimated fair value of this investment was Cdn$84 million (December 31, 2009 - Cdn$88 million). As fair value information is not readily determinable for the Company's investment in ABCP, the fair value was based on a valuation technique estimating the fair value from the perspective of a market participant. Term debt Term debt includes $11 million due within one year. Due to the short period to maturity of Term debt, the carrying value as presented in the consolidated balance sheet is a reasonable estimate of the Company fair value. (c) Credit risk the Company's financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, held to maturity investments, and foreign exchange forward contracts with positive fair values. The Company's held for trading investments include an investment in ABCP. Given the continuing uncertainties regarding the value of the underlying assets, the amount and timing over cash flows and the risk of collateral calls in the event that spreads widened considerably, the Company could be exposed to further losses on the Company investment. Cash and cash equivalents, which consists of short-term investments, are only invested in governments, bank term deposits and bank commercial paper with an investment grade credit rating. Credit risk is further reduced by limiting the amount which is invested in certain governments or any major financial institution. the Company is also exposed to credit risk from the potential default by any of the Company counterparties on the Company foreign exchange forward contracts. the Company the Company mitigates this credit risk by dealing with counterparties who are major financial institutions that the Company the Company anticipates will satisfy counterparties who are major financial institutions that the Company anticipates obligations under the contracts. In the normal course of business, the Company the Company is exposed to credit risk from the Company customers, substantially all of which are in the automotive industry and are subject to credit risks associated with the automotive industry. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, sales to the Company's six largest customers represented 80% and 81% of the Company's total sales, respectively, and substantially all of Company sales are to customers in which the Company has ongoing contractual relationships. (d) Currency risk the Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates when manufacturing facilities have committed to the delivery of products for which the selling price has been quoted in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency, or when materials and equipment are purchased in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency. In an effort to manage this net foreign exchange exposure, the Company the Company employs hedging programs, primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. As at June 30, 2010, the net foreign exchange exposure was not material. (e) Interest rate risk the Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk due to the short-term maturity of the Company monetary current assets and current liabilities. In particular, the amount of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents is impacted more by the investment decisions made and the demands to have available cash on hand, than by movements in the interest rates over a given period. In addition, the Company is not exposed to interest rate risk on the Company term debt instruments as the interest rates on these instruments are fixed. 13. Segmented Information Three months ended

• Magna Powertrain’s system delivers additional stability with reduced emissions Kia Motors and Magna Powertrain, an operating unit of Magna International Inc., today announced the official launch of the new Dynamax™ All-Wheel-Drive (AWD) system in the all new Kia Sportage. “The new Dynamax AWD system represents a significant technical advance that will bring real benefits to our customers,” comments Mr. Soon-Nam Lee, Director of Overseas Marketing, Kia Motors Corporation. “The all new Sportage compact SUV is an exciting newcomer to our product lineup and the availability of such a responsive AWD system for the first time in a Kia, will raise this model’s appeal for many potential buyers.” “Dynamax strategically positions both companies for global growth in the AWD segment, delivering enhanced driving performance with the additional benefit of lower fuel consumption and reduced emissions,” said Jake Hirsch, President of Magna Powertrain. Kia’s new Sportage compact SUV is the first of several vehicles planned to feature Dynamax. Technical Background
Dynamax is designed to continuously monitor driving conditions and anticipate AWD system requirements, compared to other AWD systems which can only react to conditions after they occur. Dynamax’s intelligent control unit continuously analyzes data from the vehicle controller, and through a multi-plate clutch, the coupling system is fully controllable via an electro-hydraulic actuation system. This Dynamax system behavior is completely transparent to the driver. Other advantages of Dynamax include:
• Improved lateral stability while cornering.
• Removal of unintended over and under steer by reducing unwanted traction forces to
 the front and rear axle.
• High thermal capacity, which helps prevent overheating and subsequent shutdown of the coupling during events such as hill climbing and trailer towing. In addition, greater efficiency is achieved through the intelligent control electronics, providing the torque required for enhanced traction in a variety of driving situations. As a result lower fuel consumption and reduced CO2 emissions are achieved. Furthermore, electronic components are optimally sized for minimal energy usage. Dynamax offers true AWD for drivers who want an exciting driving experience with enhanced safety and performance. Editors’ Notes Kia Motors Europe

535,34,2010-05-06,,Press Release - Magna announces proposal to eliminate control block and implement single vote share structure,,/2010/05/06/press-release---magna-announces-proposal-to-eliminate-control-block-and-implement-single-vote-share-structure,true,,"Please click HERE for a PDF version of the release. - Magna annonce une proposition pour éliminer le bloc de contrôle et mettre en place une organisation du capital social à vote unique - Magna gibt Vorschlag bekannt, die Kontrolle durch einen Aktionärsblock zu eliminieren und gleiches Stimmrecht für alle Aktien einzuführen AURORA, ON, May 6, 2010 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ --Magna International Inc. (TSX: MG.A, NYSE: MGA) today announced that it has entered into a transaction agreement with the Stronach Trust under which holders of Magna's Class A subordinate voting shares would be given the opportunity to decide whether to eliminate the dual class share capital structure through which Magna's founder, Frank Stronach, and his family have controlled Magna since the late 1970s. The proposed transaction would also: - set a termination date and declining fee schedule for the consulting,
 business development and business services contracts Magna has in
 place with Frank Stronach and his affiliated entities; and
 - establish a joint venture with the Stronach group to jointly continue
 to pursue opportunities in the vehicle electrification business.
 The transaction would be effected by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement, and be subject to the approval of a majority of Magna's minority Class A shareholders. ""We believe the proposed transaction, if approved by shareholders, has the potential to unlock significant share value for Magna shareholders and establish a strong foundation for the company's continued and long-term success"", said Don Walker and Siegfried Wolf, Co-Chief Executive Officers of Magna. ""The proposed transaction is intended to reduce or eliminate the discount at which Magna currently trades relative to its peers, more closely align all shareholder interests, and enhance Magna's potential business opportunity for the electrification of future vehicles."" Frank Stronach, Magna's Chairman and founder, commented, ""The ability for an entrepreneur to raise growth capital under a multiple voting share structure has enabled Canada to create a number of world-class companies, like Magna. For me, that opportunity occurred in the late 1970s, when I gave up a sizeable portion of my total equity value as part of a shareholder-approved reorganization in exchange for the control that enabled me to establish the principles, culture and entrepreneurial framework that have been the cornerstone of Magna's impressive growth and success over the years."" ""While I am content to maintain the status quo, I understand the potential benefits of management's proposal, particularly the opportunity to establish a strong foundation for the future while preserving Magna's unique corporate culture. Accordingly, if the Class A shareholders are supportive of the proposed transaction, the Stronach Trust is prepared to move forward under the proposed new capital structure. If shareholders prefer instead to retain the status quo, I am equally confident that Magna will continue to succeed under its current structure. Regardless of their decision, I have full confidence in our management and employees, and in the operating principles that have served Magna so well and made it the great company that it is today."" Investment Community Conference Call Management will discuss the proposed transaction in greater detail on its previously scheduled quarterly earnings conference call, which will be held today at 7:30 am ET. Dial-in and replay instructions are provided at the end of this press release. Terms of the Transaction The transaction agreement is between Magna and the Stronach Trust, which indirectly owns all of the 726,829 outstanding Class B Shares. Because each Class B share carries 300 votes, the Stronach Trust has approximately 66% of Magna's voting rights. If the arrangement is approved by Class A shareholders and the court, Magna would purchase for cancellation all 726,829 Class B Shares and the Stronach Trust would indirectly receive 9 million newly issued Class A Shares and US$300 million in cash. Based on the closing price of Magna's Class A shares on the New York Stock Exchange on May 5, 2010 of US$62.53, the transaction would have a total value of US$863 million. After the transaction, Magna would have approximately 121 million shares outstanding, each of which would carry one vote per share. The shares held indirectly by the Stronach Trust would represent an equal equity ownership and voting interest of 7.44%. In addition, Magna's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation would be amended to remove the Class B Shares from the authorized capital and to make non-substantive consequential changes to its Articles, including renaming the Class A Subordinate Voting Shares as Common Shares and eliminating provisions which no longer apply due to the elimination of the Class B Shares. Vincent J. Galifi, Magna's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, stated, ""Magna has historically traded at a discount to its industry peers, despite delivering comparable or better operating and financial performance while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We believe the proposed transaction could reduce or eliminate that discount, broaden Magna's appeal to investors who do not -- as a matter of preference or internal policy -- invest in companies with multiple vote share structures and establish a strong platform for future success. We also believe the proposed joint venture is a good way for Magna to pursue an opportunity that has significant growth potential, but which also bears risk and uncertainty."" Amended Consulting Contracts If the arrangement is approved, Magna would amend its existing consulting, business development and business services contracts with Mr. Stronach and his affiliated entities, Stronach & Co. and Stronach Consulting Corp. These contracts are currently renewable on an annual basis. Under the proposed amendments, these contracts would terminate on December 31, 2014 and fees payable prior to that date would be reduced from the current 3% of Magna's Pre-Tax Profits Before Profit Sharing (as defined in the Corporate Constitution) over a transition and phase-out period as follows: - 2.75% in 2011,
 - 2.50% in 2012,
 - 2.25% in 2013, and
 - 2.00% in 2014.
 Mr. Stronach's ongoing role and participation on the Board would be subject to the same nomination and election process that applies to all other directors. The current intention of the Board is for Mr. Stronach to continue to serve as Chairman, although he would resign as a member of the Board's nominating committee. Vehicle Electrification Joint Venture The proposed new joint venture would involve the engineering, development and integration of electric vehicles of any type, the development, testing and manufacturing of batteries and battery packs for hybrid (H) and electric vehicles (EV) and all ancillary activities in connection with electric vehicle technologies. Magna would invest $220 million for a 73% interest. Magna's contribution would include the assets of Magna's recently established E-Car Systems vehicle electrification and battery business unit, certain other vehicle electrification assets, and the balance in cash. Among other operations, Magna E-Car includes the Ford battery electric vehicle (BEV) integration program that launches next year. The Stronach group would invest $80 million in cash for a 27% interest in the joint venture and would have effective control through the right to appoint three of five board members, with Magna appointing the remaining two members. Although the joint venture would be free to pursue any type of business activity connected with electric vehicles, Magna would have an unrestricted right to engage in competitive activities outside of the joint venture, and neither party would be obligated to provide any future funding or financial assistance beyond its initial contribution. Next Steps The proposed share capital reorganization would be implemented pursuant to a court-approved plan of arrangement and will require the approval of a majority of the votes cast by minority Class A shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders expected to take place in late June or July of this year. In addition to shareholder and court approvals, the transaction is subject to approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange, the finalization of definitive agreements and customary closing conditions, as well as certain amendments to the consulting agreements through which Frank Stronach and certain of his affiliated entities provide consulting services to the Magna group of companies. The execution of the transaction agreement was approved by Magna's Board of Directors after receiving the report of a Special Committee of independent directors of Magna comprised of Messrs. Michael D. Harris, who acted as Chair of the Committee, Donald Resnick and Louis E. Lataif. The Special Committee received independent legal advice from Fasken Martineau LLP, independent financial advice from CIBC World Markets Inc. and independent valuation advice concerning the E-Car joint venture from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. ""We believe this proposal responds to the concerns Class A shareholders have raised about Magna's multiple voting share structure, and that the decision to proceed or not should be in their hands,"" said Mr. Harris, Magna's Lead Director. ""If the Class A shareholders do not approve the transaction, Magna will continue to operate under its current structure. Whatever the outcome, Magna's current Board and management remain committed to the culture and operating principles embodied in the Corporate Constitution and Employee Charter."" While the Board of Directors did not make a recommendation on how shareholders should vote, various considerations which they believe shareholders should take into account and a summary of the advice received from the independent advisors, as well as the detailed transaction terms, the background to the proposal, the process followed by the independent directors in reviewing the proposal with the benefit of independent legal and financial advisors, and other relevant information will be contained in the proxy materials for the special meeting of shareholders to be called to consider the plan of arrangement.

""We believe The proposed transaction, if approved by shareholders, has the potential to unlock significant share value for Magna shareholders and establish a strong foundation for the company's continued and long-term success"", said Don Walker and Siegfried Wolf, Co-Chief Executive Officers of Magna. ""The proposed transaction is intended to reduce or eliminate the discount at which Magna currently trades relative to Magna peers, more closely align all shareholder interests, and enhance Magna's potential business opportunity for the electrification of future vehicles."" Frank Stronach, Magna's Chairman and founder, commented, ""The ability for an entrepreneur to raise growth capital under a multiple voting share structure has enabled Canada to create a number of world-class companies, like Magna. For me, that opportunity occurred in the late 1970s, when I gave up a sizeable portion of my total equity value as part of a shareholder-approved reorganization in exchange for the control that enabled me to establish the principles, culture and entrepreneurial framework that have been the cornerstone of Magna's impressive growth and success over the years."" ""While I am content to maintain the status quo, I understand the potential benefits of management's proposal, particularly the opportunity to establish a strong foundation for the future while preserving Magna's unique corporate culture. Accordingly, if the Class A shareholders are supportive of the proposed transaction, the Stronach Trust is prepared to move forward under the proposed new capital structure. If shareholders prefer instead to retain the status quo, I am equally confident that Magna will continue to succeed under Magna current structure. Regardless of their decision, I have full confidence in the Stronach Trust management and employees, and in the operating principles that have served Magna so well and made it the great company that it is today."" Investment Community Conference Call Management will discuss the proposed transaction in greater detail on Investment Community Conference Call Management previously scheduled quarterly earnings conference call, which will be held today at 7:30 am ET. Dial-in and replay instructions are provided at the end of This Press Release. Terms of the Transaction The transaction agreement is between Magna and the Stronach Trust, which indirectly owns all of the 726,829 outstanding Class B Shares. Because each Class B share carries 300 votes, the Stronach Trust has approximately 66% of Magna's voting rights. If the arrangement is approved by Class A shareholders and the court, Magna would purchase for cancellation all 726,829 Class B Shares and the Stronach Trust would indirectly receive 9 million newly issued Class A Shares and US$300 million in cash. Based on the closing price of Magna's Class A shares on the New York Stock Exchange on May 5, 2010 of US$62.53, the Transaction would have a total value of US$863 million. After the Transaction, Magna would have approximately 121 million shares outstanding, each of which would carry one vote per share. the 726,829 outstanding Class B Shares would represent an equal equity ownership and voting interest of 7.44%. In addition, Magna's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation would be amended to remove the 726,829 outstanding Class B Shares from the authorized capital and to make non-substantive consequential changes to the 726,829 outstanding Class B Shares Articles, including renaming the Class A Subordinate Voting Shares as Common Shares and eliminating provisions which no longer apply due to the elimination of the 726,829 outstanding Class B Shares. Vincent J. Galifi, Magna's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, stated, Magna Magna has historically traded at a discount to Magna industry peers, despite delivering comparable or better operating and financial performance while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We believe the Transaction could reduce or eliminate a discount to its industry peers, broaden Magna's appeal to investors who do not -- as a matter of preference or internal policy -- invest in companies with multiple vote share structures and establish a strong platform for future success. We also believe the proposed joint venture is a good way for Magna to pursue an opportunity that has significant growth potential, but which also bears risk and uncertainty."" Amended Consulting Contracts If the arrangement is approved, Magna would amend Magna existing consulting, business development and business services contracts with Mr. Stronach and his affiliated entities, Stronach & Co. and Stronach Consulting Corp. These contracts are currently renewable on an annual basis. Under the proposed amendments, Stronach Consulting Corp. These contracts would terminate on December 31, 2014 and fees payable prior to that date would be reduced from the current 3% of Magna's Pre-Tax Profits Before Profit Sharing (as defined in the Corporate Constitution) over a transition and phase-out period as follows: - 2.75% in 2011,
 - 2.50% in 2012,
 - 2.25% in 2013, and
 - 2.00% in 2014.
 Stronach & Co.'s ongoing role and participation on the Board would be subject to the same nomination and election process that applies to all other directors. The current intention of the Board is for Stronach & Co. to continue to serve as Chairman, although Stronach & Co. would resign as a member of the Board's nominating committee. Vehicle Electrification Joint Venture Vehicle Electrification Joint Venture would involve the engineering, development and integration of electric vehicles of any type, the development, testing and manufacturing of batteries and battery packs for hybrid (H) and electric vehicles (EV) and all ancillary activities in connection with electric vehicle technologies. Magna would invest $220 million for a 73% interest. Magna's contribution would include the assets of Magna's recently established E-Car Systems vehicle electrification and battery business unit, certain other vehicle electrification assets, and the balance in cash. Among other operations, Magna E-Car includes the Ford battery electric vehicle (BEV) integration program that launches next year. Magna E-Car would invest $80 million in cash for a 27% interest in Vehicle Electrification Joint Venture and would have effective control through the right to appoint three of five board members, with Magna appointing the remaining two members. Although Vehicle Electrification Joint Venture would be free to pursue any type of business activity connected with electric vehicles, Magna would have an unrestricted right to engage in competitive activities outside of Vehicle Electrification Joint Venture, and neither party would be obligated to provide any future funding or financial assistance beyond Magna initial contribution. Next Steps The proposed share capital reorganization would be implemented pursuant to a court-approved plan of arrangement and will require the approval of a majority of the votes cast by minority Class A shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders expected to take place in late June or July of this year. In addition to shareholder and court approvals, the transaction is subject to approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange, the finalization of definitive agreements and customary closing conditions, as well as certain amendments to the consulting agreements through which Frank Stronach and certain of Frank Stronach affiliated entities provide consulting services to the Magna group of companies. The execution of the transaction agreement was approved by Magna's Board of Directors after receiving the report of a Special Committee of independent directors of Magna comprised of Messrs. Michael D. Harris, who acted as Chair of a Special Committee of independent directors of Magna, Donald Resnick and Louis E. Lataif. a Special Committee of independent directors of Magna received independent legal advice from Fasken Martineau LLP, independent financial advice from CIBC World Markets Inc. and independent valuation advice concerning the E-Car joint venture from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. ""We believe this proposal responds to the concerns Class A shareholders have raised about Magna's multiple voting share structure, and that the decision to proceed or not should be in Class A shareholders hands,"" said Mr. Harris, Magna's Lead Director. ""If the Class A shareholders do not approve the transaction, Magna will continue to operate under Magna current structure. Whatever the outcome, Magna's current Board and management remain committed to the culture and operating principles embodied in the Corporate Constitution and Employee Charter."" While the Board Directors did not make a recommendation on how shareholders should vote, various considerations which shareholders believe shareholders should take into account and a summary of the advice received from the independent advisors, as well as the detailed transaction terms, the background to this proposal, the process followed by the independent directors in reviewing this proposal with the benefit of independent legal and financial advisors, and other relevant information will be contained in the proxy materials for the special meeting of shareholders to be called to consider the plan of arrangement.

Financial Position ------------------------------------------------------------------------- All amounts in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Position (""MD&A"") are in U.S. dollars and all tabular amounts are in millions of U.S. dollars, except per share figures and average dollar content per vehicle, which are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. When we use the terms ""we"", ""us"", ""our"" or ""Magna"", we are referring to Magna International Inc. and its subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities, unless the context otherwise requires. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2010 included in this Press Release, and the audited consolidated financial statements and MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2009 included in our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2010 have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") with respect to the preparation of interim financial information and the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009 have been prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP. This MD&A has been prepared as at May 6, 2010. OVERVIEW ------------------------------------------------------------------------- We are the most diversified global automotive supplier. We design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced automotive systems, assemblies, modules and components, and engineer and assemble complete vehicles, primarily for sale to original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"") of cars and light trucks. Our capabilities include the design, engineering, testing and manufacture of automotive interior systems; seating systems; closure systems; body and chassis systems; vision systems; electronic systems; exterior systems; powertrain systems; roof systems; hybrid and electric vehicles/systems; as well as complete vehicle engineering and assembly. We follow a corporate policy of functional and operational decentralization, pursuant to which we conduct our operations through divisions, each of which is an autonomous business unit operating within pre-determined guidelines. As at March 31, 2010, we had 240 manufacturing divisions and 76 product development, engineering and sales centres in 25 countries. Our operations are segmented on a geographic basis between North America, Europe and Rest of World (primarily Asia, South America and Africa). A Co-Chief Executive Officer heads management in each of our two primary markets, North America and Europe. The role of the North American and European management teams is to manage our interests to ensure a coordinated effort across our different capabilities. In addition to maintaining key customer, supplier and government contacts in their respective markets, our regional management teams centrally manage key aspects of our operations while permitting our divisions enough flexibility through our decentralized structure to foster an entrepreneurial environment. HIGHLIGHTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- We continued to experience a recovery in the automotive industry in the first quarter of 2010, particularly in North America. North American light vehicle production increased 67% in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the extremely low level of production experienced in the first quarter of 2009. Even compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, North American light vehicle production increased 3% in the first quarter of 2010. The key reasons for the increase in North American light vehicle production are the improvement in North American auto sales over the past number of months, combined with low levels of dealer inventories relative to long-term historical averages. In Western Europe, light vehicle production increased 33% over the first quarter of 2009, and 3% over the fourth quarter of 2009. However, while European auto sales have remained strong relative to the North American auto market, they have recently begun to decline from the sales levels experienced in the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect this negative auto sales trend to adversely impact Western European light vehicle production for the remainder of 2010. Our first quarter results largely reflect the significantly improved levels of light vehicle production in our two principal markets, North America and Europe, combined with the benefits of our restructuring, right-sizing and other cost reduction efforts over the past couple of years. Our first quarter 2010 total sales increased 54% over the first quarter of 2009, as North American, European and Rest of World production sales, as well as complete vehicle assembly sales all posted increases, as compared to the first quarter of 2009. Operating income increased $515 million to $285 million, compared to an operating loss of $230 million in the first quarter of 2009. In light of our return to profitability, our Board of Directors reinstated our quarterly dividend, amounting to $0.18 per share in respect of the first quarter of 2010. While we remain cautious about the European automotive market, reflecting the negative impacts of vehicle sales ""pulled forward"" over the past year, as well as uncertainty about macroeconomic factors impacting a number of European countries recently, we are encouraged by the recovery in automotive sales in a number of other markets, including North America. We are working hard to contain costs and continue to improve capacity utilization, so as to fully benefit from the recovery in vehicle production. FINANCIAL RESULTS SUMMARY ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the first quarter of 2010, we posted sales of $5.5 billion, an increase of 54% from the first quarter of 2009. This higher sales level was a result of increases in our North American, European and Rest of World production sales, and complete vehicle assembly sales offset in part by a decrease in tooling, engineering and other sales. Comparing the first quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2009: 
 - North American vehicle production increased by 67% and average dollar
 content per vehicle increased 5%;
 - European vehicle production increased 33% and average dollar content
 per vehicle increased 15%; and
 - Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 11% to $446 million from
 $401 million, as complete vehicle assembly volumes increased 49%.
 
 During the first quarter of 2010, we generated operating income of $285 million compared to an operating loss of $230 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the first quarter of 2010, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $501 million increase in operating income was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, operating income was positively impacted by: 
 - lower costs associated with restructuring and downsizing activities;
 - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives undertaken during or subsequent to the first
 quarter of 2009;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence
 Innovation s.r.o, (""Cadence""); and
 - the sale of certain underperforming divisions during or subsequent to
 the first quarter of 2009.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - higher costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches or for
 programs that have not fully ramped up production;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - higher electric vehicle development costs;
 - higher costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics
 capabilities;
 - higher executive compensation; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the first quarter of
 2009.
 
 During the first quarter of 2010, net income was $223 million compared to a net loss of $200 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the first quarter of 2010, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income for 2010 increased $409 million. The increase in net income was a result of the increase in operating income partially offset by higher income taxes. During the first quarter of 2010, our diluted earnings per share were $1.97 compared to diluted loss per share of $1.79 for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the first quarter of 2010, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, diluted earnings per share for 2010 increased $3.64. The increase in diluted earnings per share is as a result of the increase in net income, excluding unusual items, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the first quarter of 2010. The increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to an increase in the number of diluted shares associated with restricted stock and stock options since such shares were anti-dilutive in the first quarter of 2009. UNUSUAL ITEMS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the first quarter of 2010, we sold an electronics systems facility in China and realized a $14 million ($14 million after tax) gain. This gain contributed $0.12 to our diluted earnings per share. There were no unusual items in the first quarter of 2009. INDUSTRY TRENDS AND RISKS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our success is primarily dependent upon the levels of North American and European car and light truck production by our customers and the relative amount of content we have on the various programs. OEM production volumes in different regions may be impacted by factors which may vary from one region to the next, including but not limited to general economic and political conditions, interest rates, credit availability, energy and fuel prices, international conflicts, labour relations issues, regulatory requirements, trade agreements, infrastructure, legislative changes, and environmental emissions and safety issues. These factors and a number of other economic, industry and risk factors which also affect our success, including such things as relative currency values, commodities prices, price reduction pressures from our customers, the financial condition of our supply base and competition from manufacturers with operations in low cost countries, are discussed in our Annual Information Form and Annual Report on Form 40-F, each in respect of the year ended December 31, 2009, and remain substantially unchanged in respect of the first quarter ended March 31, 2010.

 The preceding table reflects the average foreign exchange rates between the most common currencies in which we conduct business and our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The significant changes in these foreign exchange rates for the three months ended March 31, 2010 impacted the reported U.S. dollar amounts of our sales, expenses and income. The results of operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates in the table above for the relevant period. Throughout this MD&A, reference is made to the impact of translation of foreign operations on reported U.S. dollar amounts where relevant. Our results can also be affected by the impact of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency transactions (such as raw material purchases or sales denominated in foreign currencies). However, as a result of hedging programs employed by us, foreign currency transactions in the current period have not been fully impacted by movements in exchange rates. We record foreign currency transactions at the hedged rate where applicable. Finally, holding gains and losses on foreign currency denominated monetary items, which are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, impact reported results.

 External Production Sales - North America External production sales in North America increased 75% or $1.17 billion to $2.74 billion for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $1.57 billion for the first quarter of 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 67% increase in North American vehicle production volumes combined with a 5% increase in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. Our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 5% or $44 to $953 for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $909 for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, our average dollar content per vehicle decreased primarily as a result of: 
 - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - GM full-sized pickups and SUV's;
 - BMW X5;
 - Ford F-Series and Lincoln Mark LT;
 - Dodge Ram;
 - BMW X6/Hybrid; and
 - Mercedes-Benz R-Class, M-Class and GL-Class;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the first
 quarter of 2009, including the Pontiac G5 and G6; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the first quarter of
 2009.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan and Lincoln MKZ;
 - Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave;
 - Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX;
 - Chevrolet Cobalt;
 - Dodge Journey;
 - Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and Volkswagen
 Routan; and
 - Ford Flex;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the first quarter
 of 2009, including the:
 - Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain;
 - Cadillac SRX; and
 - Chevrolet Camaro; and
 - the acquisition of several facilities from Meridian Automotive
 Systems Inc in the second quarter of 2009.
 
 External Production Sales - Europe External production sales in Europe increased 53% or $609 million to $1.76 billion for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $1.15 billion for the first quarter of 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 33% increase in European vehicle production volumes combined with a 15% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. Our average dollar content per vehicle increased by 15% or $67 to $521 for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $454 for the first quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: 
 - acquisitions completed subsequent to the first quarter of 2009,
 including Cadence;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening of
 the euro and British pound, each against the U.S. dollar; and
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the first
 quarter of 2009, including the:
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Opel Astra;
 - Mercedes-Benz E-Class; and
 - Audi A5.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - smart fortwo;
 - MINI Cooper; and
 - BMW 3-Series;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the first
 quarter of 2009; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the first quarter of
 2009.
 
 External Production Sales - Rest of World External production sales in Rest of World increased 112% or $121 million to $229 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $108 million for the first quarter of 2009. The increase in production sales is primarily as a result of: 
 - increased production and/or content on certain programs in China,
 Korea and Brazil;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the first quarter
 of 2009 in China and Japan; and
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales as a result of the
 strengthening of the Brazilian real and Korean won, each against the
 U.S. dollar.
 
 Complete Vehicle Assembly Sales The terms of our various vehicle assembly contracts differ with respect to the ownership of components and supplies related to the assembly process and the method of determining the selling price to the OEM customer. Under certain contracts we are acting as principal and purchased components and systems in assembled vehicles are included in our inventory and cost of goods sold. These costs are reflected on a full-cost basis in the selling price of the final assembled vehicle to the OEM customer. Other contracts provide that third party components and systems are held on consignment by us, and the selling price to the OEM customer reflects a value added assembly fee only. Production levels of the various vehicles assembled by us have an impact on the level of our sales and profitability. In addition, the relative proportion of programs accounted for on a full-cost basis and programs accounted for on a value-added basis, also impacts our level of sales and operating margin percentage, but may not necessarily affect our overall level of profitability. Assuming no change in total vehicles assembled, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a full-cost basis has the effect of increasing the level of total sales, however, because purchased components are included in cost of goods sold, profitability as a percentage of total sales is reduced. Conversely, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a value-added basis has the effect of reducing the level of total sales and increasing profitability as a percentage of total sales.

 Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 11% or $45 million to $446 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $401 million for the first quarter of 2009 while assembly volumes increased 49% or 5,928 units. The increase in complete vehicle assembly sales is primarily as a result of: 
 - the launch of new assembly programs subsequent to the first quarter
 of 2009, including the Peugeot RCZ and the Aston Martin Rapide;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening of
 the euro against the U.S. dollar; and
 - an increase in assembly volumes for the BMW X3, Chrysler 300 and Jeep
 Grand Cherokee.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - the end of production of the Saab 9(3) Convertible in the fourth
 quarter of 2009; and
 - lower assembly volumes for the Mercedes-Benz G-Class.
 
 In addition, several new complete vehicle assembly programs have been awarded that are scheduled to launch at various times between 2010 and 2013. Tooling, Engineering and Other Sales Tooling, engineering and other sales decreased 3% or $9 million to $333 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $342 million for the first quarter of 2009. In the first quarter of 2010 the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: 
 - Chevrolet Silverado;
 - BMW X3;
 - Audi A8;
 - Mercedes-Benz R-Class;
 - Porsche Cayenne;
 - MINI Cooper and Crossman;
 - Opel/Vauxhall Astra;
 - Jeep Grand Cherokee; and
 - Mercedes-Benz E-Class.
 
 In the first quarter of 2009 the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: 
 - Chevrolet Silverado;
 - MINI Crossman;
 - Cadillac SRX and Saab 9-4X;
 - Chevrolet Equinox and Suzuki XL7;
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - BMW X3;
 - Ford Taurus;
 - Hummer H3; and
 - Cadillac DTS and Cadillac CTS.
 
 In addition, tooling, engineering and other sales increased as a result of the strengthening of the euro and Canadian dollar, each against the U.S. dollar. Gross Margin Gross margin increased $498 million to $742 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $244 million for the first quarter of 2009 and gross margin as a percentage of total sales increased to 13.5% for the first quarter of 2010 compared to 6.8% for the first quarter of 2009. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of total sales was substantially due to increased gross margin earned as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, gross margin as a percentage of total sales was positively impacted by: 
 - lower costs associated with restructuring and downsizing activities;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives that were undertaken during or subsequent to the
 first quarter of 2009;
 - acquisitions completed subsequent to the first quarter of 2009; and
 - a decrease in tooling sales that earn low or no margins.
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - higher costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches, primarily
 in Europe;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher electric vehicle development costs;
 - higher costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics
 capabilities;
 - an increase in complete vehicle assembly sales which have a lower
 gross margin than our consolidated average; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the first quarter of
 2009.
 
 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization costs decreased 2% or $4 million to $165 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $169 million for the first quarter of 2009. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily as a result of: 
 - the impairment of certain assets subsequent to the first quarter of
 2009; and
 - the sale or disposition of certain facilities subsequent to the first
 quarter of 2009.
 
 These factors were partially offset by 
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar depreciation and amortization due
 to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and euro, each against
 the U.S. dollar; and
 - acquisitions completed subsequent to the first quarter of 2009.
 
 Selling, General and Administrative (""SG&A"") SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 5.5% for the first quarter of 2010 compared to 8.4% for the first quarter of 2009. The unusual item discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section positively impacted SG&A as a percentage of total sales in the first quarter of 2010 by 0.2%. Excluding this unusual item, SG&A as a percentage of total sales decreased by 2.7%. SG&A expense decreased $1 million to $301 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $302 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the $14 million unusual item recorded in the first quarter of 2010 (as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section), SG&A expenses increased by $13 million primarily as a result of: 
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar SG&A expense due to the
 strengthening of the Canadian dollar and euro, each against the U.S.
 dollar;
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - higher executive compensation; and
 - acquisitions completed subsequent to the first quarter of 2009.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - cost saving initiatives, including reduced discretionary spending,
 employee reductions and benefit plan changes;
 - lower costs associated with restructuring and downsizing activities;
 and
 - the sale or disposition of certain facilities during or subsequent to
 the first quarter of 2009.

 North America EBIT in North America increased $343 million to earnings of $254 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $89 million for the first quarter of 2009 substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: 
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - lower costs associated with restructuring and downsizing activities;
 and
 - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives undertaken during or subsequent to the first
 quarter of 2009.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - higher affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher electric vehicle development costs;
 - higher costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the first quarter of
 2009.
 
 Europe EBIT in Europe increased $113 million to a loss of $6 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $119 million for the first quarter of 2009 substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: 
 - lower costs associated with restructuring and downsizing activities;
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence;
 - the sale of certain underperforming divisions during or subsequent to
 the first quarter of 2009;
 - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives undertaken during or subsequent to the first
 quarter of 2009; and
 - lower commodity costs.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - higher costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches or for
 programs that have not fully ramped up production;
 - higher costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics
 capabilities;
 - higher affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - higher warranty costs;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the first quarter of
 2009.
 
 Rest of World Rest of World EBIT increased $30 million to $29 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $1 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the Rest of World unusual item discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $16 million increase in EBIT was primarily as a result of: 
 - additional margin earned on increased production sales; and
 - incremental margin earned on new programs that launched during or
 subsequent to the first quarter of 2009.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - higher launch costs incurred, primarily in Japan; and
 - a decrease in equity income earned.
 
 Corporate and Other Corporate and Other EBIT increased $23 million to $5 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $18 million for the first quarter of 2009 primarily as a result of: 
 - an increase in affiliation fees earned from our divisions; and
 - an increase in equity income earned.
 
 These factors were partially offset by increased executive compensation. Interest (Income) Expense, net During the first quarter of 2010, we recorded net interest income of $3 million, compared to $3 million of net interest expense for the first quarter of 2009. The $6 million increase in net interest income is as a result of a reduction in interest expense due to the repayment of our 7.08% Subordinated Debentures and our 6.5% Convertible Subordinated Debenture subsequent to the first quarter of 2009. Operating Income (Loss) Operating income increased $515 million to $285 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $230 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual item discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, operating income for the first quarter of 2010 increased $501 million. The increase in operating income is the result of the increase in EBIT and the increase in net interest income earned, both as discussed above. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate on operating income (excluding equity income) increased to 22.2% for the first quarter of 2010 compared to 13.0% for the first quarter of 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, income tax rates were impacted by the unusual item discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section. Excluding unusual items, our effective income tax rate increased to 23.4% for the first quarter of 2010. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 returned to normal rates as a result of our return to profitability in most jurisdictions. In addition, the effective rate for the first quarter of 2010 decreased by losses that were previously not benefited. Net Income (Loss) Net income increased $423 million to $223 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to a net loss of $200 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual item discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income increased $409 million. The increase in net income is the result of the increase in operating income partially offset by higher income taxes, both as discussed above. Earnings (Loss) per Share

 Diluted earnings per share increased $3.76 to $1.97 for the first quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $1.79 for the first quarter of 2009. The increase in diluted earnings per share is the result of an increase in net income partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the quarter. The increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to an increase in the number of diluted shares associated with restricted stock and stock options since such shares were anti-dilutive in the first quarter of 2009.

 The increase in accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, accrued salaries and wages and other accrued liabilities in the first quarter of 2010 was primarily due to the increase in production activities compared to the first quarter of 2009. The increase in income taxes payable was primarily due to a higher tax provision resulting from increased earnings combined with reduced instalment requirements.

 Fixed assets, investments and other assets additions In the first quarter of 2010 we invested $133 million in fixed assets. While investments were made to refurbish or replace assets consumed in the normal course of business and for productivity improvements, a large portion of the investment in the first quarter of 2010 was for manufacturing equipment for programs that will be launching subsequent to the first quarter of 2010. In the first quarter of 2010, we invested $31 million in other assets related primarily to fully reimbursable planning and engineering costs at our complete vehicle engineering and assembly operations and our powertrain operations for programs that will be launching subsequent to the first quarter of 2010. Purchase of subsidiaries During the first quarter of 2010, we acquired two facilities in our complete vehicle engineering and assembly operations for cash consideration of $2 million. Proceeds from disposition Proceeds from disposal in the first quarter of 2010 were $165 million which included: 
 - normal course reimbursement received in respect of planning and
 engineering costs that were capitalized in prior periods;
 - the cash proceeds received on the sale of an electronics facility;
 - a cash payment received on the sale of a long-term engineering
 receivable; and
 - a cash payment received with respect to our investment in asset-
 backed commercial paper (""ABCP""). Financing For the three months

 In December 2008, in response to the uncertainty related to the financial viability of some of our key customers in North America, we drew down on our term and operating lines of credit. In February and March 2009, as the situation facing some of our key customers became clearer, we repaid $767 million of the outstanding lines of credit. During the first quarter of 2010, we received cash proceeds of $7 million on the exercise of stock options for Class A Subordinate Voting Shares. During the second quarter of 2009, our Board of Directors suspended payment of dividends and, as a result, no dividends were paid on our Class A Subordinate Voting or Class B Shares in the first quarter of 2010 compared to a dividend of $0.18 per share for the first quarter of 2009. 
Financing Resources As at As at March 31, December 31, 2010 2009 Change ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Liabilities Bank indebtedness $ 54 $ 48 Long-term debt due within one year 14 16 Long-term debt 102 115 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 170 179 Shareholders' equity 7,671 7,360 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total capitalization $ 7,841 $ 7,539 $ 302 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total capitalization increased by $0.3 billion to $7.8 billion at March 31, 2010 compared to $7.5 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase in capitalization was a result of a $0.3 billion increase in shareholders' equity. The increase in shareholders' equity was primarily as a result of: 
 - net income earned during the first quarter of 2010 (as discussed
 above);
 - net unrealized gains on cash flow hedges; and
 - a $17 million increase in accumulated net unrealized gains on
 translation of net investment in foreign operations, primarily as a
 result of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S.
 dollar between December 31, 2009 and March 31, 2010.
 
 Cash Resources During the first quarter of 2010, our cash resources increased by $0.1 billion to $1.4 billion primarily as a result of the cash provided from operating activities, as discussed above. In addition to our cash resources, we had term and operating lines of credit totalling $2.1 billion. The unused and available portion of our lines of credit decreased $0.1 billion to $1.8 billion during the first quarter of 2010. Maximum Number of Shares Issuable The following table presents the maximum number of shares that would be outstanding if all of the outstanding options and Subordinated Debentures issued and outstanding at May 6, 2010 were exercised or converted: 
 Class A Subordinate Voting and Class B Shares 112,764,722
 Stock options(i) 5,869,910
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 118,634,632
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- (i) Options to purchase Class A Subordinate Voting Shares are exercisable by the holder in accordance with the vesting provisions and upon payment of the exercise price as may be determined from time to time pursuant to our stock option plans. Includes options to acquire 2,525,000 Class A Subordinate Voting Shares which were granted conditional on ratification by our Shareholders at our Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 6, 2010. Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Financing There have been no material changes with respect to the contractual obligations requiring annual payments during the first quarter of 2010 that are outside the ordinary course of our business. Refer to our MD&A included in our 2009 Annual Report. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- On May 6, 2010, we entered into a transaction agreement with the Stronach Trust under which holders of our Class A Subordinate Voting Shares would be given the opportunity to decide whether to eliminate the dual class share capital structure. The proposed transaction would also: (i) set a termination date and declining fee schedule for the consulting, business development and business services contracts we have in place with Frank Stronach and his affiliated entities; and (ii) establish a joint venture with the Stronach group to jointly continue to pursue opportunities in the vehicle electrification business. (a) Terms of the Transaction If the arrangement is approved by Class A shareholders and the court, we would purchase for cancellation all 726,829 Class B Shares and, the Stronach Trust would indirectly receive 9.0 million newly issued Class A Shares and $300 million in cash. After the transaction, we would have 121.0 million shares outstanding, each of which would carry one vote. The shares held indirectly by the Stronach Trust would represent an equal equity ownership and voting interest of 7.4%. In addition, Magna's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation would be amended to remove the Class B Shares from the authorized capital and to make non-substantive consequential changes to our Articles, including renaming the Class A Subordinate Voting Shares as Common Shares and eliminating provisions which no longer apply due to the elimination of the Class B Shares. (b) Vehicle Electrification Joint Venture The proposed new joint venture would involve the engineering, development and integration of electric vehicles of any type, the development, testing and manufacturing of batteries and battery packs for hybrid (H) and electric vehicles (EV) and all ancillary activities in connection with electric vehicle technologies. We would invest $220 million for a 73% interest. Our contribution would include the assets of our recently established E-Car Systems vehicle electrification and battery business unit, certain other vehicle electrification assets, and the balance in cash. The Stronach group would invest $80 million in cash for a 27% interest in the joint venture and would have effective control through the right to appoint three of five board members. The proposed share capital reorganization would be implemented pursuant to a court-approved plan of arrangement and will require the approval of a majority of the votes cast by minority Class A shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders expected to take place in late June or July of this year. In addition to shareholder and court approvals, the transaction is subject to approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange, the finalization of definitive agreements and customary closing conditions, as well as certain amendments to the consulting agreements through which Frank Stronach, and certain of his affiliated entities provide consulting services to the Magna group of companies. The execution of the transaction agreement was approved by our Board of Directors after receiving the report of a Special Committee of independent directors of Magna. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- From time to time, we may be contingently liable for litigation and other claims. Refer to note 24 of our 2009 audited consolidated financial statements, which describes these claims. For a discussion of risk factors relating to legal and other claims against us, refer to page 35 of our Annual Information Form and Annual Report on Form 40-F, each in respect of the year ended December 31, 2009. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- The previous discussion contains statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of applicable securities legislation, including, but not limited to, statements relating to: European automobile sales and light vehicle production; and the timing of new program launches. The forward-looking information in this document is presented for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward-looking statements may include financial and other projections, as well as statements regarding our future plans, objectives or economic performance, or the assumptions underlying any of the foregoing, and other statements that are not recitations of historical fact. We use words such as ""may"", ""would"", ""could"", ""should"", ""will"", ""likely"", ""expect"", ""anticipate"", ""believe"", ""intend"", ""plan"", ""forecast"", ""outlook"", ""project"", ""estimate"" and similar expressions suggesting future outcomes or events to identify forward-looking statements. Any such forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and are based on assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and our perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors we believe are appropriate in the circumstances. However, whether actual results and developments will conform with our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks, assumptions and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and the effects of which can be difficult to predict, including, without limitation: the potential for a slower than anticipated economic recovery or a deterioration of economic conditions; production volumes and sales levels which are below forecast levels; our dependence on outsourcing by our customers; the termination or non renewal by our customers of any material contracts; our ability to identify and successfully exploit shifts in technology; restructuring, downsizing and/or other significant non-recurring costs; impairment charges; our ability to successfully grow our sales to non-traditional customers; unfavourable product or customer mix; risks of conducting business in foreign countries, including China, India, Brazil, Russia and other developing markets; our ability to quickly shift our manufacturing footprint to take advantage of lower cost manufacturing opportunities; disruptions in the capital and credit markets; fluctuations in relative currency values; our ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions; pricing pressures, including our ability to offset price concessions demanded by our customers; warranty and recall costs; the financial condition and credit worthiness of some of our OEM customers, including the potential that such customers may not make, or may seek to delay or reduce, payments owed to us; the financial condition of some of our suppliers and the risk of their insolvency, bankruptcy or financial restructuring; the highly competitive nature of the automotive parts supply business; product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage; changes in our mix of earnings between jurisdictions with lower tax rates and those with higher tax rates, as well as our ability to fully benefit tax losses; other potential tax exposures; legal claims against us; work stoppages and labour relations disputes; changes in laws and governmental regulations; costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations; potential conflicts of interest involving our indirect controlling shareholder, the Stronach Trust; and other factors set out in our Annual Information Form filed with securities commissions in Canada and our annual report on Form 40-F filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and subsequent filings. In evaluating forward-looking statements, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements and readers should specifically consider the various factors which could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. Unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, we do not intend, nor do we undertake any obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent information, events, results or circumstances or otherwise.

otherwise noted)
------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Magna International Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively ""Magna"" or the ""Company"") have been prepared in United States dollars following Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") with respect to the preparation of interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required in the preparation of annual financial statements and therefore should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2009 audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's 2009 Annual Report. These interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the same accounting policies as the December 31, 2009 annual consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which consist only of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position at March 31, 2010 and the results of operations and cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2010 and 2009. 2.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------- (b) Fair value The Company determined the estimated fair values of its financial instruments based on valuation methodologies it believes are appropriate; however, considerable judgment is required to develop these estimates. Accordingly, these estimated fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The estimated fair value amounts can be materially affected by the use of different assumptions or methodologies. The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments are described below: Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, bank indebtedness, accounts payable, accrued salaries and wages, other accrued liabilities and income taxes payable. Due to the short period to maturity of the instruments, the carrying values as presented in the consolidated balance sheets are reasonable estimates of fair values. Investments At March 31, 2010, the Company held Canadian third party asset- backed commercial paper (""ABCP"") with a face value of Cdn$127 million (December 31, 2009 - Cdn$134 million). The carrying value and estimated fair value of this investment was Cdn$84 million (December 31, 2009 - Cdn$88 million). As fair value information is not readily determinable for the Company's investment in ABCP, the fair value was based on a valuation technique estimating the fair value from the perspective of a market participant. During the quarter, the Company sold notes for approximately Cdn$4 million, which approximated their carrying value. Term debt The Company's term debt includes $14 million due within one year. Due to the short period to maturity of this debt, the carrying value as presented in the consolidated balance sheet is a reasonable estimate of its fair value. (c) Credit risk The Company's financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, held to maturity investments, and foreign exchange forward contracts with positive fair values. The Company's held for trading investments include an investment in ABCP. Given the continuing uncertainties regarding the value of the underlying assets, the amount and timing over cash flows and the risk of collateral calls in the event that spreads widened considerably, the Company could be exposed to further losses on its investment. Cash and cash equivalents, which consists of short-term investments, are only invested in governments, bank term deposits and bank commercial paper with an investment grade credit rating. Credit risk is further reduced by limiting the amount which is invested in certain governments or any major financial institution. The Company is also exposed to credit risk from the potential default by any of its counterparties on its foreign exchange forward contracts. The Company mitigates this credit risk by dealing with counterparties who are major financial institutions that the Company anticipates will satisfy their obligations under the contracts. In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to credit risk from its customers, substantially all of which are in the automotive industry and are subject to credit risks associated with the automotive industry. Sales to the Company's six largest customers represented 81% of the Company's total sales and substantially all of our sales are to customers in which the Company has ongoing contractual relationships. (d) Currency risk The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates when manufacturing facilities have committed to the delivery of products for which the selling price has been quoted in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency, or when materials and equipment are purchased in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency. In an effort to manage this net foreign exchange exposure, the Company employs hedging programs, primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. As at March 31, 2010, the net foreign exchange exposure was not material. (e) Interest rate risk The Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk due to the short-term maturity of its monetary current assets and current liabilities. In particular, the amount of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents is impacted more by the investment decisions made and the demands to have available cash on hand, than by movements in the interest rates over a given period. In addition, the Company is not exposed to interest rate risk on its long-term debt instruments as the interest rates on these instruments are fixed. 12. SEGMENTED INFORMATION Three months ended

SUBSEQUENT EVENT On May 6, 2010, the Company entered into a transaction agreement with the Stronach Trust under which holders of Magna's Class A subordinate voting shares would be given the opportunity to decide whether to eliminate the dual class share capital structure. The proposed transaction would also: (i) set a termination date and declining fee schedule for the consulting, business development and business services contracts Magna has in place with Frank Stronach and his affiliated entities; and (ii) establish a joint venture with the Stronach group to jointly continue to pursue opportunities in the vehicle electrification business. (a) Terms of the Transaction If the arrangement is approved by Class A shareholders and the court, Magna would purchase for cancellation all 726,829 Class B Shares and, the Stronach Trust would indirectly receive 9.0 million newly issued Class A Shares and $300 million in cash. After the transaction, Magna would have 121.0 million shares outstanding, each of which would carry one vote. The shares held indirectly by the Stronach Trust would represent an equal equity ownership and voting interest of 7.4%. In addition, Magna's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation would be amended to remove the Class B Shares from the authorized capital and to make non-substantive consequential changes to its Articles, including renaming the Class A Subordinate Voting Shares as Common Shares and eliminating provisions which no longer apply due to the elimination of the Class B Shares. (b) Vehicle Electrification Joint Venture The proposed new joint venture would involve the engineering, development and integration of electric vehicles of any type, the development, testing and manufacturing of batteries and battery packs for hybrid (H) and electric vehicles (EV) and all ancillary activities in connection with electric vehicle technologies. Magna would invest $220 million for a 73% interest. Magna's contribution would include the assets of Magna's recently established E-Car Systems vehicle electrification and battery business unit, certain other vehicle electrification assets, and the balance in cash. The Stronach group would invest $80 million in cash for a 27% interest in the joint venture and would have effective control through the right to appoint three of five board members. The proposed share capital reorganization would be implemented pursuant to a court-approved plan of arrangement and will require the approval of a majority of the votes cast by minority Class A shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders expected to take place in late June or July of this year. In addition to shareholder and court approvals, the transaction is subject to approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange, the finalization of definitive agreements and customary closing conditions, as well as certain amendments to the consulting agreements through which Frank Stronach, and certain of his affiliated entities provide consulting services to the Magna group of companies. The execution of the transaction agreement was approved by Magna's Board of Directors after receiving the report of a Special Committee of independent directors of Magna. 14.

We design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced automotive systems, assemblies, modules and components, and engineer and assemble complete vehicles, primarily for sale to original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"") of cars and light trucks. We capabilities include the design, engineering, testing and manufacture of automotive interior systems; seating systems; closure systems; body and chassis systems; vision systems; electronic systems; exterior systems; powertrain systems; roof systems; hybrid and electric vehicles/systems; as well as complete vehicle engineering and assembly. We follow a corporate policy of functional and operational decentralization, pursuant to which We conduct We operations through divisions, each of which is an autonomous business unit operating within pre-determined guidelines. As at March 31, 2010, We had 240 manufacturing divisions and 76 product development, engineering and sales centres in 25 countries. We operations are segmented on a geographic basis between North America, Europe and Rest of World (primarily Asia, South America and Africa). A Co-Chief Executive Officer heads management in each of our two primary markets, North America and Europe. The role of the North American and European management teams is to manage our interests to ensure a coordinated effort across our different capabilities. In addition to maintaining key customer, supplier and government contacts in supplier and government contacts respective markets, the North American and European management teams centrally manage key aspects of our operations while permitting our divisions enough flexibility through our decentralized structure to foster an entrepreneurial environment. HIGHLIGHTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- our continued to experience a recovery in the automotive industry in the first quarter of 2010, particularly in North America. North American light vehicle production increased 67% in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the extremely low level of production experienced in the first quarter of 2009. Even compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, North American light vehicle production increased 3% in the first quarter of 2010. The key reasons for the increase in North American light vehicle production are the improvement in North American auto sales over the past number of months, combined with low levels of dealer inventories relative to long-term historical averages. In Western Europe, light vehicle production increased 33% over the first quarter of 2009, and 3% over the fourth quarter of 2009. However, while European auto sales have remained strong relative to the North American auto market, European auto sales have recently begun to decline from the sales levels experienced in the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect this negative auto sales trend to adversely impact Western European light vehicle production for the remainder of 2010. We first quarter results largely reflect the significantly improved levels of light vehicle production in We two principal markets, North America and Europe, combined with the benefits of We restructuring, right-sizing and other cost reduction efforts over the past couple of years. We first quarter 2010 total sales increased 54% over the first quarter of 2009, as North American, European and Rest of World production sales, as well as complete vehicle assembly sales all posted increases, as compared to the first quarter of 2009. Operating income increased $515 million to $285 million, compared to an operating loss of $230 million in the first quarter of 2009. In light of We return to profitability, We Board of Directors reinstated We quarterly dividend, amounting to $0.18 per share in respect of the first quarter of 2010. While we remain cautious about the European automotive market, reflecting the negative impacts of vehicle sales ""pulled forward"" over the past year, as well as uncertainty about macroeconomic factors impacting a number of European countries recently, we are encouraged by the recovery in automotive sales in a number of other markets, including North America. we are working hard to contain costs and continue to improve capacity utilization, so as to fully benefit from the recovery in vehicle production. FINANCIAL RESULTS SUMMARY ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the first quarter of 2010, we posted sales of $5.5 billion, an increase of 54% from the first quarter of 2009. This higher sales level was a result of increases in our North American, European and Rest of World production sales, and complete vehicle assembly sales offset in part by a decrease in tooling, engineering and other sales. Comparing the first quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2009: 
 - North American vehicle production increased by 67% and average dollar
 content per vehicle increased 5%;
 - European vehicle production increased 33% and average dollar content
 per vehicle increased 15%; and
 - Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 11% to $446 million from
 $401 million, as complete vehicle assembly volumes increased 49%.
 
 During the first quarter of 2010, we generated operating income of $285 million compared to an operating loss of $230 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the first quarter of 2010, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $501 million increase in operating income was substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, operating income was positively impacted by: 
 - lower costs associated with restructuring and downsizing activities;
 - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives undertaken during or subsequent to the first
 quarter of 2009;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence
 Innovation s.r.o, (""Cadence""); and
 - the sale of certain underperforming divisions during or subsequent to
 the first quarter of 2009.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - higher costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches or for
 programs that have not fully ramped up production;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - higher electric vehicle development costs;
 - higher costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics
 capabilities;
 - higher executive compensation; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the first quarter of
 2009.
 
 During the first quarter of 2010, net income was $223 million compared to a net loss of $200 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the first quarter of 2010, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income for 2010 increased $409 million. The increase in net income was a result of the increase in operating income partially offset by higher income taxes. During the first quarter of 2010, our diluted earnings per share were $1.97 compared to diluted loss per share of $1.79 for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the first quarter of 2010, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, diluted earnings per share for 2010 increased $3.64. The increase in diluted earnings per share is as a result of the increase in net income, excluding unusual items, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the first quarter of 2010. The increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to an increase in the number of diluted shares associated with restricted stock and stock options since such shares were anti-dilutive in the first quarter of 2009. UNUSUAL ITEMS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the first quarter of 2010, our sold an electronics systems facility in China and realized a $14 million ($14 million after tax) gain. a $14 million ($14 million after tax) gain contributed $0.12 to our diluted earnings per share. There were no unusual items in the first quarter of 2009. INDUSTRY TRENDS AND RISKS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- our success is primarily dependent upon the levels of North American and European car and light truck production by our customers and the relative amount of content our have on the various programs. OEM production volumes in different regions may be impacted by factors which may vary from one region to the next, including but not limited to general economic and political conditions, interest rates, credit availability, energy and fuel prices, international conflicts, labour relations issues, regulatory requirements, trade agreements, infrastructure, legislative changes, and environmental emissions and safety issues. These factors and a number of other economic, industry and risk factors which also affect our success, including such things as relative currency values, commodities prices, price reduction pressures from our customers, the financial condition of our supply base and competition from manufacturers with operations in low cost countries, are discussed in our Annual Information Form and Annual Report on Form 40-F, each in respect of the year ended December 31, 2009, and remain substantially unchanged in respect of the first quarter ended March 31, 2010.

 The preceding table reflects the average foreign exchange rates between the most common currencies in which we conduct business and our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The significant changes in these foreign exchange rates for the three months ended March 31, 2010 impacted the reported U.S. dollar amounts of our sales, expenses and income. The results of operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates in the table above for the relevant period. Throughout this MD&A, reference is made to the impact of translation of foreign operations on reported U.S. dollar amounts where relevant. The results of operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar can also be affected by the impact of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency transactions (such as raw material purchases or sales denominated in foreign currencies). However, as a result of hedging programs employed by us, foreign currency transactions in the current period have not been fully impacted by movements in exchange rates. our record foreign currency transactions at the hedged rate where applicable. Finally, holding gains and losses on foreign currency denominated monetary items, which are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, impact reported results.

 External Production Sales - North America External production sales in North America increased 75% or $1.17 billion to $2.74 billion for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $1.57 billion for the first quarter of 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 67% increase in North American vehicle production volumes combined with a 5% increase in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. our North American average dollar content per vehicle grew by 5% or $44 to $953 for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $909 for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, our average dollar content per vehicle decreased primarily as a result of: 
 - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - GM full-sized pickups and SUV's;
 - BMW X5;
 - Ford F-Series and Lincoln Mark LT;
 - Dodge Ram;
 - BMW X6/Hybrid; and
 - Mercedes-Benz R-Class, M-Class and GL-Class;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the first
 quarter of 2009, including the Pontiac G5 and G6; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the first quarter of
 2009.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan and Lincoln MKZ;
 - Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave;
 - Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX;
 - Chevrolet Cobalt;
 - Dodge Journey;
 - Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and Volkswagen
 Routan; and
 - Ford Flex;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the first quarter
 of 2009, including the:
 - Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain;
 - Cadillac SRX; and
 - Chevrolet Camaro; and
 - the acquisition of several facilities from Meridian Automotive
 Systems Inc in the second quarter of 2009.
 
 External Production Sales - Europe External production sales in Europe increased 53% or $609 million to $1.76 billion for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $1.15 billion for the first quarter of 2009. This increase in production sales reflects a 33% increase in European vehicle production volumes combined with a 15% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. Our average dollar content per vehicle increased by 15% or $67 to $521 for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $454 for the first quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of: 
 - acquisitions completed subsequent to the first quarter of 2009,
 including Cadence;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening of
 the euro and British pound, each against the U.S. dollar; and
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the first
 quarter of 2009, including the:
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Opel Astra;
 - Mercedes-Benz E-Class; and
 - Audi A5.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or content
 on certain programs, including the:
 - Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan and Lincoln MKZ;
 - Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave;
 - Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX;
 - Chevrolet Cobalt;
 - Dodge Journey;
 - Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and Volkswagen
 Routan; and
 - Ford Flex;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the first quarter
 of 2009, including the:
 - Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain.
 
 External Production Sales - Rest of World External production sales in Rest of World increased 112% or $121 million to $229 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $108 million for the first quarter of 2009. The increase in production sales is primarily as a result of: 
 - increased production and/or content on certain programs in China,
 Korea and Brazil;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the first quarter
 of 2009 in China and Japan; and
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales as a result of the
 strengthening of the Brazilian real and Korean won, each against the
 U.S. dollar.
 
 Complete Vehicle Assembly Sales The terms of our various vehicle assembly contracts differ with respect to the ownership of components and supplies related to the assembly process and the method of determining the selling price to the OEM customer. Under certain contracts our are acting as principal and purchased components and systems in assembled vehicles are included in our inventory and cost of goods sold. These costs are reflected on a full-cost basis in the selling price of the final assembled vehicle to the OEM customer. Other contracts provide that third party components and systems are held on consignment by us, and the selling price to the OEM customer reflects a value added assembly fee only. Production levels of the various vehicles assembled by us have an impact on the level of us sales and profitability. In addition, the relative proportion of programs accounted for on a full-cost basis and programs accounted for on a value-added basis, also impacts our level of sales and operating margin percentage, but may not necessarily affect our overall level of profitability. Assuming no change in total vehicles assembled, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a full-cost basis has the effect of increasing the level of total sales, however, because purchased components are included in cost of goods sold, profitability as a percentage of total sales is reduced. Conversely, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a value-added basis has the effect of reducing the level of total sales and increasing profitability as a percentage of total sales.

 Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 11% or $45 million to $446 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $401 million for the first quarter of 2009 while assembly volumes increased 49% or 5,928 units. The increase in complete vehicle assembly sales is primarily as a result of: 
 - the launch of new assembly programs subsequent to the first quarter
 of 2009, including the Peugeot RCZ and the Aston Martin Rapide;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening of
 the euro against the U.S. dollar; and
 - an increase in assembly volumes for the BMW X3, Chrysler 300 and Jeep
 Grand Cherokee.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - the end of production of the Saab 9(3) Convertible in the fourth
 quarter of 2009; and
 - lower assembly volumes for the Mercedes-Benz G-Class.
 
 In addition, several new complete vehicle assembly programs have been awarded that are scheduled to launch at various times between 2010 and 2013. Tooling, Engineering and Other Sales Tooling, engineering and other sales decreased 3% or $9 million to $333 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $342 million for the first quarter of 2009. In the first quarter of 2010 the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: 
 - Chevrolet Silverado;
 - BMW X3;
 - Audi A8;
 - Mercedes-Benz R-Class;
 - Porsche Cayenne;
 - MINI Cooper and Crossman;
 - Opel/Vauxhall Astra;
 - Jeep Grand Cherokee; and
 - Mercedes-Benz E-Class.
 
 In the first quarter of 2009 the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: 
 - Chevrolet Silverado;
 - MINI Crossman;
 - Cadillac SRX and Saab 9-4X;
 - Chevrolet Equinox and Suzuki XL7;
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - BMW X3;
 - Ford Taurus;
 - Hummer H3; and
 - Cadillac DTS and Cadillac CTS.
 
 In addition, tooling, engineering and other sales increased as a result of the strengthening of the euro and Canadian dollar, each against the U.S. dollar. Gross Margin Gross margin increased $498 million to $742 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $244 million for the first quarter of 2009 and gross margin as a percentage of total sales increased to 13.5% for the first quarter of 2010 compared to 6.8% for the first quarter of 2009. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of total sales was substantially due to increased gross margin earned as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, gross margin as a percentage of total sales was positively impacted by: 
 - lower costs associated with restructuring and downsizing activities;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives that were undertaken during or subsequent to the
 first quarter of 2009;
 - acquisitions completed subsequent to the first quarter of 2009; and
 - a decrease in tooling sales that earn low or no margins.
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - higher costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches, primarily
 in Europe;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher electric vehicle development costs;
 - higher costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics
 capabilities;
 - an increase in complete vehicle assembly sales which have a lower
 gross margin than our consolidated average; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the first quarter of
 2009.
 
 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization costs decreased 2% or $4 million to $165 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $169 million for the first quarter of 2009. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily as a result of: 
 - the impairment of certain assets subsequent to the first quarter of
 2009; and
 - the sale or disposition of certain facilities subsequent to the first
 quarter of 2009.
 
 These factors were partially offset by 
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar depreciation and amortization due
 to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and euro, each against
 the U.S. dollar; and
 - acquisitions completed subsequent to the first quarter of 2009.
 
 Selling, General and Administrative (""SG&A"") SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 5.5% for the first quarter of 2010 compared to 8.4% for the first quarter of 2009. The unusual item discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section positively impacted SG&A as a percentage of total sales in the first quarter of 2010 by 0.2%. Excluding this unusual item, SG&A as a percentage of total sales decreased by 2.7%. SG&A expense decreased $1 million to $301 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $302 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the $14 million unusual item recorded in the first quarter of 2010 (as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section), SG&A expenses increased by $13 million primarily as a result of: 
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar SG&A expense due to the
 strengthening of the Canadian dollar and euroeuro, each against the U.S.
 dollar;
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - higher executive compensation; and
 - acquisitions completed subsequent to the first quarter of 2009.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - cost saving initiatives, including reduced discretionary spending,
 employee reductions and benefit plan changes;
 - lower costs associated with restructuring and downsizing activities;
 and
 - the sale or disposition of certain facilities during or subsequent to
 the first quarter of 2009.

 North America EBIT in North America increased $343 million to earnings of $254 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $89 million for the first quarter of 2009 substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, (1) EBIT was positively impacted by: 
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - lower costs associated with restructuring and downsizing activities;
 and
 - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives undertaken during or subsequent to the first
 quarter of 2009.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - higher incentive compensation;
 - higher affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - higher electric vehicle development costs;
 - higher costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the first quarter of
 2009.
 
 Europe EBIT in Europe increased $113 million to a loss of $6 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $119 million for the first quarter of 2009 substantially due to increased margins earned on higher sales as a result of significantly higher vehicle production volumes. In addition, (1) EBIT was positively impacted by: 
 - lower costs associated with restructuring and downsizing activities;
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence;
 - the sale of certain underperforming divisions during or subsequent to
 the first quarter of 2009;
 - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives undertaken during or subsequent to the first
 quarter of 2009; and
 - lower commodity costs.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - higher costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches or for
 programs that have not fully ramped up production;
 - higher costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics
 capabilities;
 - higher affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - higher warranty costs;
 - employee profit sharing, as no profit sharing was recorded in 2009;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the first quarter of
 2009.
 
 Rest of World Rest of World EBIT increased $30 million to $29 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $1 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the Rest of World unusual item discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $16 million increase in (1) EBIT was primarily as a result of: 
 - additional margin earned on increased production sales; and
 - incremental margin earned on new programs that launched during or
 subsequent to the first quarter of 2009.
 
 These factors were partially offset by: 
 - higher launch costs incurred, primarily in Japan; and
 - a decrease in equity income earned.
 
 Corporate and Other Corporate and Other EBIT increased $23 million to $5 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $18 million for the first quarter of 2009 primarily as a result of: 
 - an increase in affiliation fees earned from our divisions; and
 - an increase in equity income earned.
 
 These factors were partially offset by increased executive compensation. Interest (Income) Expense, net During the first quarter of 2010, we recorded net interest income of $3 million, compared to $3 million of net interest expense for the first quarter of 2009. The $6 million increase in net interest income is as a result of a reduction in interest expense due to the repayment of our 7.08% Subordinated Debentures and our 6.5% Convertible Subordinated Debenture subsequent to the first quarter of 2009. Operating Income (Loss) Operating income increased $515 million to $285 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $230 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual item discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, operating income for the first quarter of 2010 increased $501 million. The increase in operating income is the result of the increase in (1) EBIT and the increase in net interest income earned, both as discussed above. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate on operating income (excluding equity income) increased to 22.2% for the first quarter of 2010 compared to 13.0% for the first quarter of 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, income tax rates were impacted by the unusual item discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section. Excluding unusual items, our effective income tax rate increased to 23.4% for the first quarter of 2010. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 returned to normal rates as a result of our return to profitability in most jurisdictions. In addition, the effective rate for the first quarter of 2010 decreased by losses that were previously not benefited. Net Income (Loss) Net income increased $423 million to $223 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to a net loss of $200 million for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the unusual item discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" sectionthe ""Unusual Items"" section, net income increased $409 million. The increase in net income is the result of the increase in operating income partially offset by higher income taxes, both as discussed above. Earnings (Loss) per Share

 Diluted earnings per share increased $3.76 to $1.97 for the first quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $1.79 for the first quarter of 2009. The increase in diluted earnings per share is the result of an increase in net income partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the quarter. The increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to an increase in the number of diluted shares associated with restricted stock and stock options since such shares were anti-dilutive in the first quarter of 2009.

 Fixed assets, investments and other assets additions In the first quarter of 2010 we invested $133 million in fixed assets. While investments were made to refurbish or replace assets consumed in the normal course of business and for productivity improvements, a large portion of the investment in the first quarter of 2010 was for manufacturing equipment for programs that will be launching subsequent to the first quarter of 2010. In the first quarter of 2010, we invested $31 million in other assets related primarily to fully reimbursable planning and engineering costs at we complete vehicle engineering and assembly operations and we powertrain operations for programs that will be launching subsequent to the first quarter of 2010. Purchase of subsidiaries During the first quarter of 2010, we acquired two facilities in we complete vehicle engineering and assembly operations for cash consideration of $2 million. Proceeds from disposition Proceeds from disposal in the first quarter of 2010 were $165 million which included: 
 - normal course reimbursement received in respect of planning and
 engineering costs that were capitalized in prior periods;
 - the cash proceeds received on the sale of an electronics facility;
 - a cash payment received on the sale of a long-term engineering
 receivable; and
 - a cash payment received with respect to we investment in asset-

In February and March 2009, as the situation facing some of our key customers became clearer, our repaid $767 million of the outstanding lines of credit. During the first quarter of 2010, our received cash proceeds of $7 million on the exercise of stock options for Class A Subordinate Voting Shares. During the second quarter of 2009, our Board of Directors suspended payment of dividends and, as a result, no dividends were paid on our Class A Subordinate Voting or Class B Shares in the first quarter of 2010 compared to a dividend of $0.18 per share for the first quarter of 2009.

  was a result of a $0.3 billion increase in shareholders' equity. a $0.3 billion increase in shareholders' equity was primarily as a result of: 
 - net income earned during the first quarter of 2010 (as discussed
 above);
 - net unrealized gains on cash flow hedges; and
 - a $17 million increase in accumulated net unrealized gains on
 translation of net investment in foreign operations, primarily as a
 result of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S.
 dollar between December 31, 2009 and March 31, 2010.
 
 Cash Resources During the first quarter of 2010, our cash resources increased by $0.1 billion to $1.4 billion primarily as a result of the cash provided from operating activities, as discussed above. In addition to our cash resources, our had term and operating lines of credit totalling $2.1 billion. The unused and available portion of our lines of credit decreased $0.1 billion to $1.8 billion during the first quarter of 2010. Maximum Number of Shares Issuable The following table presents the maximum number of shares that would be outstanding if all of the outstanding options and Subordinated Debentures issued and outstanding at May 6, 2010 were exercised or converted:

Includes options to acquire 2,525,000 Class A Subordinate Voting Shares which were granted conditional on ratification by our Shareholders at our Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 6, 2010. Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Financing There have been no material changes with respect to the contractual obligations requiring annual payments during the first quarter of 2010 that are outside the ordinary course of our business. Refer to our MD&A included in our 2009 Annual Report. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- On May 6, 2010, our entered into a transaction agreement with the Stronach Trust under which holders of our Class A Subordinate Voting Shares would be given the opportunity to decide whether to eliminate the dual class share capital structure. The proposed transaction would also: (i) set a termination date and declining fee schedule for the consulting, business development and business services contracts we have in place with Frank Stronach and Frank Stronach affiliated entities; and (ii) establish a joint venture with the Frank Stronach group to jointly continue to pursue opportunities in the vehicle electrification business. (a) Terms of the Transaction If the arrangement is approved by Class A shareholders and the court, we would purchase for cancellation all 726,829 Class B Shares and, the Stronach Trust would indirectly receive 9.0 million newly issued Class A Shares and $300 million in cash. After The proposed transaction, we would have 121.0 million shares outstanding, each of which would carry one vote. all 726,829 Class B Shares would represent an equal equity ownership and voting interest of 7.4%. In addition, Magna's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation would be amended to remove all 726,829 Class B Shares from the authorized capital and to make non-substantive consequential changes to our Articles, including renaming the Class A Subordinate Voting Shares as Common Shares and eliminating provisions which no longer apply due to the elimination of all 726,829 Class B Shares. (b) Vehicle Electrification Joint Venture (b) Vehicle Electrification Joint Venture would involve the engineering, development and integration of electric vehicles of any type, the development, testing and manufacturing of batteries and battery packs for hybrid (H) and electric vehicles (EV) and all ancillary activities in connection with electric vehicle technologies. We would invest $220 million for a 73% interest. We contribution would include the assets of We recently established E-Car Systems vehicle electrification and battery business unit, certain other vehicle electrification assets, and the balance in cash. the Stronach group would invest $80 million in cash for a 27% interest in (b) Vehicle Electrification Joint Venture and would have effective control through the right to appoint three of five board members. The proposed share capital reorganization would be implemented pursuant to a court-approved plan of arrangement and will require the approval of a majority of the votes cast by minority Class A shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders expected to take place in late June or July of this year. In addition to shareholder and court approvals, the transaction is subject to approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange, the finalization of definitive agreements and customary closing conditions, as well as certain amendments to the consulting agreements through which Frank Stronach, and certain of Frank Stronach affiliated entities provide consulting services to the Magna group of companies. The execution of a transaction agreement with the Stronach Trust under which holders of our Class A Subordinate Voting Shares would be given the opportunity to decide whether to eliminate the dual class share capital structure was approved by our Board of Directors after receiving the report of a Special Committee of independent directors of Magna.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------- (b) Fair value the Company determined the estimated fair values of the Company financial instruments based on valuation methodologies the Company believes are appropriate; however, considerable judgment is required to develop the estimated fair values of its financial instruments based on valuation methodologies it believes are appropriate. Accordingly, these estimated fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange can be materially affected by the use of different assumptions or methodologies. the use of different assumptions or methodologies used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments are described below: Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, bank indebtedness, accounts payable, accrued salaries and wages, other accrued liabilities and income taxes payable. Due to the short period to maturity of the instruments, the carrying values as presented in the consolidated balance sheets are reasonable estimates of fair values. Investments At March 31, 2010, the Company held Canadian third party asset- backed commercial paper (""ABCP"") with a face value of Cdn$127 million (December 31, 2009 - Cdn$134 million). The carrying value and estimated fair value of this investment was Cdn$84 million (December 31, 2009 - Cdn$88 million). As fair value information is not readily determinable for the Company's investment in ABCP, the fair value was based on a valuation technique estimating the fair value from the perspective of a market participant. During the quarter, the Company sold notes for approximately Cdn$4 million, which approximated their carrying value. Term debt Term debt includes $14 million due within one year. Due to the short period to maturity of Term debt, the carrying value as presented in the consolidated balance sheet is a reasonable estimate of the Company fair value. (c) Credit risk the Company's financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, held to maturity investments, and foreign exchange forward contracts with positive fair values. The Company's held for trading investments include an investment in ABCP. Given the continuing uncertainties regarding the value of the underlying assets, the amount and timing over cash flows and the risk of collateral calls in the event that spreads widened considerably, the Company could be exposed to further losses on the Company investment. Cash and cash equivalents, which consists of short-term investments, are only invested in governments, bank term deposits and bank commercial paper with an investment grade credit rating. Credit risk is further reduced by limiting the amount which is invested in certain governments or any major financial institution. the Company is also exposed to credit risk from the potential default by any of the Company counterparties on the Company foreign exchange forward contracts. the Company the Company mitigates this credit risk by dealing with counterparties who are major financial institutions that the Company the Company anticipates will satisfy counterparties who are major financial institutions that the Company anticipates obligations under the contracts. In the normal course of business, the Company the Company is exposed to credit risk from the Company customers, substantially all of which are in the automotive industry and are subject to credit risks associated with the automotive industry. Sales to the Company's six largest customers represented 81% of the Company's total sales and substantially all of Company sales are to customers in which the Company has ongoing contractual relationships. (d) Currency risk the Company the Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates when manufacturing facilities have committed to the delivery of products for which the selling price has been quoted in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency, or when materials and equipment are purchased in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency. In an effort to manage this net foreign exchange exposure, the Company the Company employs hedging programs, primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. As at March 31, 2010, the net foreign exchange exposure was not material. (e) Interest rate risk the Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk due to the short-term maturity of the Company monetary current assets and current liabilities. In particular, the amount of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents is impacted more by the investment decisions made and the demands to have available cash on hand, than by movements in the interest rates over a given period. In addition, the Company is not exposed to interest rate risk on the Company long-term debt instruments as the interest rates on its long-term debt instruments are fixed. 12.

The primary means to achieve this will be the expansion of the product portfolio, intensified internationalization and the development of programs for new customers. Growth through product portfolio expansion When Magna Car Top Systems became a Business Unit of Magna Steyr at the beginning of the year, it added roof systems to its complete vehicle competence. The take-over and integration of Karmann Japan makes Magna Steyr one of Japan’s leading roof system developers and manufacturers and additionally strengthens Magna Steyr’s international market position in this field. As the world’s biggest contract manufacturer with complete vehicle competence, Magna Steyr will turn this segment into a “one stop shop” that offers OEMs competitive complete solutions for small to medium volume production. Growth through stronger internationalization Magna Steyr will strengthen its world-wide network of Engineering Centers and intensify its resources in India and China. This strategy is already starting to bear fruit. At the beginning of February, Guangzhou Automobile (GAC) awarded Magna Steyr a contract for comprehensive engineering services for GAC’s new CUV program. The market launch is scheduled for the beginning of 2012.
 Growth through new customers Magna Steyr extended its proven all-wheel-drive product range by adding new differentiated product lines. Two examples of innovative and tailored customer solutions are on display at our Geneva Auto Show booth. The “MINI Beachcomber Concept” is an example of the development of a concept car and realization of a prototype, while the Peugeot RCZ is an example of Magna Steyr’s ability to be a fully responsible general contractor from concept to series maturity and production of a complete vehicle (see separate press information). Other new customer projects that showcase Magna Steyr’s superior technological capability include the painted body of the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG and the complete vehicle production Aston Martin Rapide. Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Together with Mercedes-AMG, Magna Steyr engineered the aluminum body for the new Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG and has been manufacturing this extremely lightweight body in its plant in Graz since December 2009. Aston Martin Rapide The Aston Martin Rapide is the first Aston Martin to be manufactured entirely outside of Great Britain. Following a period of intensive and successful co-operation, series production in Graz is now imminent. These two vehicles are an impressive example of Magna Steyr’s competence in lightweight materials. Currently, Magna Steyr is the only automotive supplier worldwide to master Cold Metal Transfer (CMT) welding, using manual welding techniques to manufacture aluminum bodies.
 Magna Steyr With more than 100 years of experience and a wide range of products and services, Magna Steyr is the internationally leading independent engineering and manufacturing partner for car manufacturers and the provider of innovative solutions for the mobility of the future. In our capacity as a leading international provider of car roof systems, we translate the concept of freedom into a tangible and immensely pleasurable experience on wheels. However, we are not content with being our customers’ partner, we are also committed to consolidating our leading position in the industry by introducing our own ideas and new developments. Whether it is the design and assembly of entire vehicles, the development and manufacture of components and systems, or innovations for the future of the automobile, in our world cars are much more than business, they are our passion. Magna Steyr has centers of competence at 32 sites worldwide and employs 8,500 employees in North America, Europe and Asia. Contact: Mag. Daniel Witzani

With this modern concept, Magna Steyr unveils a design study which has been jointly developed upon MINI’s initiative, and built at Magna Steyr’s plant in Graz.
The MINI Beachcomber Concept is the study of a four-seater that takes up the extended possibilities of the MINI Countryman and combines it with the vision of a radical open body concept. Its outstanding qualities provide maximum driving fun and enjoyment, a clear design and extreme variability.
The MINI Beachcomber Concept was developed and built in just under four months by MINI and Magna Steyr who worked in close co-operation under the initiative of MINI. Magna Steyr was responsible for the virtual development, the concept’s design and implementation. Working closely with MINI, Magna Steyr created the design outlines and concepts, developing detailed solutions, in accordance with the customer’s ideas and requirements. The first ideas for the interior design of the concept car already existed, but were further elaborated and implemented by Magna Steyr. All design decisions regarding the MINI Beachcomber had to be approved by MINI prior to their implementation. The concept celebrated its world premiere in January 2010 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The finished concepts were implemented into a surface model during the styling phase at the Magna Steyr’s design department. Surface feasibility studies were verified directly after their completion, allowing the construction of a model immediately following technical approval. The vehicle was built in Magna Steyr’s prototyping facility in Graz together with the MINI Model Construction Unit.
The structure of the MINI Beachcomber Concept was built by taking the existing body of the MINI Countryman as a starting point. Magna Steyr’s own proven virtual development process ensured that all new spaces could be defined quickly. The vehicle was fit to drive in just four months. This was largely due to the fact that new parts were created according to Magna Steyr’s rapid prototyping process. After MINI Design had specified the colors, the MINI Beachcomber Concept was then painted in Magna Steyr’s plant in Graz. The overall production quality of the MINI Beachcomber Concept not only shows the prototype competence of Magna Steyr, but is an additional reference to its concept competence following the “Mila” series, and demonstrates its complete co-operation with an OEM.

This decrease in production sales reflects a 32% decrease in North American vehicle production volumes partially offset by a 1% increase in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. External production sales in Europe decreased 17% or $1.2 billion to $5.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $7.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease in production sales reflects a 19% decrease in European vehicle production volumes partially offset by a 2% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. Complete vehicle assembly sales decreased 47% to $1.8 billion for 2009 compared to $3.3 billion for 2008, while complete vehicle assembly volumes declined 55% to approximately 57 thousand units. During 2009, operating loss was $511 million, net loss was $493 million and diluted loss per share was $4.41, decreases of $839 million, $564 million and $5.03, respectively, each compared to 2008. During 2009 and 2008, we recorded a number of unusual items, including impairment charges associated with goodwill, long-lived assets and future tax assets, restructuring charges, foreign currency gains, net losses on disposal of a facility, future tax charges and a curtailment gain. The aggregate charge to net income for 2009 and 2008 related to unusual items totalled $195 and $313 million, respectively. On a per share basis, the aggregate net charge for unusual items totalled $1.74 and $2.75 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, we generated cash from operations of $621 million before changes in non-cash operating assets and liabilities, and invested $94 million in non-cash operating assets and liabilities. Total investment activities for 2009 were $906 million, including $629 million in fixed asset additions, a $227 million increase in investments and other assets and $50 million to purchase subsidiaries. THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 ------------------------------------ We posted sales of $5.4 billion for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, an increase of 12% from the fourth quarter of 2008. This higher sales level was a result of increases in our North American, European and Rest of World production sales and complete vehicle assembly sales, offset in part by decreases in our tooling, engineering and other sales. External production sales in North America increased 1% or $24 million to $2.42 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $2.39 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase in production sales reflects a 2% increase in North American vehicle production volumes partially offset by a 1% decrease in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. External production sales in Europe increased 35% or $450 million to $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase in production sales reflects a 13% increase in European vehicle production volumes combined with a 20% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 7% to $512 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $479 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, while complete vehicle assembly volumes declined 6% to approximately 16,000 units. During the fourth quarter of 2009, operating loss was $125 million, net loss was $139 million and diluted loss per share was $1.25, increases of $40 million, $9 million and $0.08, respectively, each compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. During the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, we recorded a number of unusual items, including restructuring charges, impairment charges associated with goodwill and long-lived assets and a loss on disposal of a facility. The aggregate charge to net income for the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008 related to unusual items totalled $134 million and $72 million, respectively. On a per share basis, the aggregate net charge for unusual items for the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008 totalled $1.20 and $0.65, respectively. During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, we generated cash from operations of $267 million before changes in non-cash operating assets and liabilities, and generated $247 million from non-cash operating assets and liabilities. Total investment activities for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $259 million, including $230 million in fixed asset additions and a $29 million increase in other assets. A more detailed discussion of our consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2009 is contained in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Position and the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which are attached to this Press Release. UPDATED 2010 OUTLOOK -------------------- For the full year 2010, we expect our consolidated sales to be between $19 billion and $20 billion, based on full year 2010 light vehicle production volumes of approximately 10.5 million units in North America and approximately 11.4 million units in Europe. Full year 2010 average dollar content per vehicle is expected to be between $895 and $925 in North America and between $510 and $535 in Europe. We expect our full year 2010 complete vehicle assembly sales to be between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion. In addition, we expect that full year 2010 spending for fixed assets will be in the range of $750 million to $800 million. This 2010 outlook assumes no significant acquisitions or divestitures. In addition, we have assumed that foreign exchange rates for the most common currencies in which we conduct business relative to our U.S. dollar reporting currency will approximate current rates. We are the most diversified global automotive supplier. We design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced automotive systems, assemblies, modules and components, and engineer and assemble complete vehicles, primarily for sale to original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"") of cars and light trucks. Our capabilities include the design, engineering, testing and manufacture of automotive interior systems; seating systems; closure systems; body and chassis systems; vision systems; electronic systems; exterior systems; powertrain systems; roof systems; hybrid and electric vehicles/systems as well as complete vehicle engineering and assembly. We have approximately 72,500 employees in 238 manufacturing operations and 79 product development, engineering and sales centres in 25 countries. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- We will hold a conference call for interested analysts and shareholders to discuss our fourth quarter and year end results on Thursday, February 25, 2010 at 7:30 a.m. EST.

We design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced automotive systems, assemblies, modules and components, and engineer and assemble complete vehicles, primarily for sale to original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"") of cars and light trucks. Our capabilities include the design, engineering, testing and manufacture of automotive interior systems; seating systems; closure systems; body and chassis systems; vision systems; electronic systems; exterior systems; powertrain systems; roof systems; hybrid and electric vehicles/systems; as well as complete vehicle engineering and assembly. We follow a corporate policy of functional and operational decentralization, pursuant to which we conduct our operations through divisions, each of which is an autonomous business unit operating within pre-determined guidelines. As at December 31, 2009, we had 238 manufacturing divisions and 79 product development, engineering and sales centres in 25 countries. Our operations are segmented on a geographic basis between North America, Europe and Rest of World (primarily Asia, South America and Africa). A Co- Chief Executive Officer heads management in each of our two primary markets, North America and Europe. The role of the North American and European management teams is to manage our interests to ensure a coordinated effort across our different capabilities. In addition to maintaining key customer, supplier and government contacts in their respective markets, our regional management teams centrally manage key aspects of our operations while permitting our divisions enough flexibility through our decentralized structure to foster an entrepreneurial environment. HIGHLIGHTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- The automotive industry had a challenging year in 2009. The year began with weak global vehicle sales and production, most notably in the North American and Western European markets. In the first half of 2009, North American and Western European vehicle production declined 50% and 33%, respectively, as compared to the first half of 2008. The worsening economic and industry conditions which became apparent in the second half of 2008 accelerated the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of OEMs and suppliers, culminating in the bankruptcy filings of Chrysler and General Motors in April and June, respectively. During their respective periods under bankruptcy protection, vehicle production for Chrysler and General Motors was negligible. More generally, annualized vehicle sales in North America for the first half of 2009 remained at levels not experienced for more than 25 years. European vehicle sales and production, while down significantly from the previous year, were buoyed by a number of ""scrappage"" programs implemented by various European governments, which generally provided financial incentives for consumers to replace older, less fuel-efficient and typically higher polluting vehicles, with new vehicles, thereby stimulating vehicle sales. We began to see signs of improvement in the second half of 2009, particularly in North America. New vehicle selling rates strengthened, as consumer confidence levels increased and economic stimuli began to work their way through various economies. In North America, vehicle inventory days declined to levels which were below long term trend levels, due in part to production shut-downs and the positive effect of a vehicle scrappage program implemented in the United States. Nevertheless, by historical standards, full year vehicle sales and production in North America and Western Europe remained at low levels. North American vehicle production ended 2009 down 32%, as compared to 2008, marking the seventh straight year of declining production. Western European production declined 19% compared to 2008, despite the impact of the various scrappage programs. In 2009, we continued with restructuring and downsizing actions in order to mitigate the impact of continued production volume declines. We also undertook a number of other cost-saving measures, including reduced discretionary spending across the organization, employee reductions, short work week schedules, reduced bonuses, voluntary wage reductions and benefit plan changes. Despite these actions, the weak production environment adversely impacted our 2009 operating results. Total sales declined 27% in 2009, compared to 2008, primarily as a result of the declines in vehicle production in North America and Western Europe, along with a 47% decline in complete vehicle assembly sales and a 16% decline in tooling, engineering and other sales. Operating income for 2009 decreased $839 million, to a loss of $511 million, from income of $328 million in 2008. On the positive side, the severe industry conditions provided opportunities for us to strengthen our business relative to some of our competitors. We were successful in securing significant takeover business in 2009. We also completed selective acquisitions, including Cadence Innovation s.r.o, located primarily in the Czech Republic (""Cadence""), and several facilities in Mexico and the U.S. from Meridian Automotive Systems Inc. (""Meridian""). An additional bright spot was the continued growth of our business and manufacturing footprint outside our traditional markets of North America and Western Europe, which contributed to a 31% increase in Rest of World production sales, our eighth straight year of increasing production sales in this segment. During a period when several of our automotive supplier competitors ceased operations, were consolidated or experienced significant financial difficulties, our strong balance sheet and overall financial flexibility leading into the economic downturn, coupled with our financial discipline, cash flow generation and significant cash preservation and cost cutting efforts allowed us to preserve shareholder value and position us well to enhance such value in the future. Our strong financial position allows us to continue to invest in innovation. Notably, in the past few years, we have been investing to expand our capabilities and footprint in electronics. We see electronics as an area of future growth for the automotive industry and for Magna. More recently, we have been investing to develop our component, system and integration capabilities in the growing hybrid/electric vehicle market. However, we will need to further invest in both electronics and hybrid/electric vehicle systems before we generate appropriate returns from these investments. Our investments in these areas negatively impacted our earnings in 2009, and our planned investments in 2010 are expected to be higher. After a very turbulent year in many automotive markets, we expect global vehicle production to grow this year, led by growth in North America, provided that overall economic conditions continue to improve. Forecast growth in North American vehicle production would reverse the seven year slide experienced in this critical vehicle market. We are less optimistic about the near-term growth potential of the Western European market, which we believe will lag in 2010 due to the impact in 2009 of scrappage incentives which mitigated what would likely have been much weaker vehicle demand last year by ""pulling forward"" sales. FINANCIAL RESULTS SUMMARY ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During 2009, we posted sales of $17.4 billion, a decrease of 27% from 2008. This lower sales level was a result of decreases in our North American and European production sales, complete vehicle assembly sales and tooling, engineering and other sales offset in part by an increase in our Rest of World production sales. Comparing 2009 to 2008: - North American average dollar content per vehicle increased 1%, while
 vehicle production declined 32%;
 - European average dollar content per vehicle increased 2%, while
 vehicle production declined 19%; and
 - Complete vehicle assembly sales decreased 47% to $1.8 billion from
 $3.3 billion, as complete vehicle assembly volumes declined 55%.
 During 2009, we generated an operating loss of $511 million compared to operating income of $328 million for 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2009 and 2008, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, operating income declined $899 million. Included in operating income for 2009 and 2008 are several ""Significant Items"" that impact operating income representing approximately $220 million and $85 million, respectively. ""Significant Items"" consist primarily of: - downsizing and other restructuring activities that have not been
 included in the ""Unusual Items"" section;
 - accounts receivable valuation allowances recorded in 2009;
 - in 2009, a $9 million favourable adjustment (2008 - $41 million
 impairment) of our investment in ABCP as discussed in the ""Cash
 Resources"" section;
 - a favourable settlement on research and development incentives during
 2008;
 - due diligence costs associated with our planned investment in Opel,
 which terminated during 2009;
 - accelerated amortization of deferred wage buydown assets at a
 powertrain systems facility in the United States during 2008;
 - the write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related
 to the cancelation of an assembly program in the fourth quarter of
 2009;
 - costs related to the delay in the start of production of a program;
 and
 - other losses on disposal of assets.
 In addition, operating income was negatively impacted by: - decreased margin earned on reduced sales as a result of significantly
 lower vehicle production volumes;
 - costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches or for programs
 that have not fully ramped up production primarily in Europe;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities;
 - costs incurred at new facilities in Russia as we continue to pursue
 opportunities in this market;
 - electric vehicle development costs;
 - costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics capabilities;
 - higher commodity costs; and
 - net customer price concessions.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 savings initiatives (including reduced discretionary spending,
 employee reductions, short work week schedules, reduced bonuses,
 voluntary wage reductions and benefit plan changes), undertaken
 during or subsequent to 2008;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities; and
 - incremental margin earned from acquisitions completed during or
 subsequent to 2008.
 During 2009, net loss was $493 million compared to net income of $71 million for 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2009 and 2008, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income for 2009 decreased $682 million. The decrease in net income was a result of the decrease in operating income partially offset by lower income taxes. During 2009, our diluted loss per share was $4.41 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.62 for 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2009 and 2008, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, diluted earnings per share for 2009 decreased $6.04. The decrease in diluted earnings per share is as a result of the decrease in net income, excluding unusual items, and a decrease in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during 2009. The decrease in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to the effect of the repurchase and cancelation of Class A Subordinate Voting Shares in 2008 under the terms of our Normal Course Issuer Bid and a decrease in the number of diluted shares associated with restricted stock and stock options since such shares were anti-dilutive in 2009.

 (a) For the year ended December 31, 2009 (i) Goodwill In conjunction with the Company's annual business planning cycle, during the fourth quarter of 2009 we determined that our Car Top Systems (""CTS"") North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired, primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic reduction in the market for soft tops, hard tops and modular retractable hard tops; and (ii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout our business planning period. Based on the reporting unit's discounted forecast cashflows, we recorded a $25 million goodwill impairment charge. In addition, during the second quarter of 2009, after failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York, we decided to wind down these operations. Given the significance of the facility's cashflows in relation to the reporting unit, management determined that it was more likely than not that goodwill at the Powertrain North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired. Therefore, we recorded a $75 million goodwill impairment charge. The goodwill impairment charges were calculated by determining the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if we had acquired the Powertrain and CTS reporting units as at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009, respectively. (ii) Long-lived Assets Also in conjunction with our annual business planning cycle, during the fourth quarter of 2009 we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $83 million. In North America, we recorded charges of $13 million related to fixed assets at a die casting facility in Canada and an anticipated under recovery of capitalized tooling costs at a stamping facility in the United States due to significantly lower volumes on certain SUV programs. In Europe, we recorded long-lived assets impairment charges of $70 million related to our CTS and exterior systems operations in Germany. At our CTS operations, long-lived asset impairment charges of $59 million were recorded related to fixed and intangible assets. The impairment charge was calculated based on CTS' discounted forecast cashflows and was necessary primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic reduction in the market for soft tops, hard tops and modular retractable hard tops; and (ii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout our business planning period. At our interiors and exteriors operations, we recorded an $11 million asset impairment charge related to specific under-utilized assets in Germany. (iii) Restructuring Costs During 2009, we recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $23 million in cost of goods sold and $3 million in selling, general and administrative expense. During the second quarter, we recorded restructuring costs of $6 million related to the planned closure of a powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York and during the fourth quarter we recorded severance and other termination benefits related to the closure of powertrain and interior systems facilities in Germany. Substantially all of the $26 million will be paid subsequent to 2009. In addition, during 2009 and 2008, we incurred costs related to downsizing various operations in our traditional markets. (b) For the year ended December 31, 2008 (i) Long-lived Assets As a result of the significant and accelerated declines in vehicle production volumes, primarily in North America, we reviewed goodwill and long- lived assets for impairment during the third quarter of 2008. Based on this analysis, during 2008 we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $283 million related primarily to our powertrain, and interior and exterior systems operations in the United States and Canada. At our powertrain operations, particularly at a facility in Syracuse, New York, asset impairment charges of $189 million were recorded primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic market shift away from truck programs, in particular four wheel drive pick-up trucks and SUVs; (ii) excess die-casting, machining and assembly capacity; and (iii) historical losses that were projected to continue throughout our business planning period. At our interiors and exteriors operations, we recorded $74 million of asset impairment charges primarily as a result of: (i) significantly lower volumes on certain pick-up truck and SUV programs; (ii) the loss of certain replacement business; (iii) capacity utilization that is not sufficient to support the current overhead structure; and (iv) historical losses that were projected to continue throughout our business planning period. Additionally, in North America we recorded asset impairment charges of $12 million related to dedicated assets at a chassis systems facility in Canada and a seating systems facility in the United States. In Europe, we recorded an $8 million asset impairment related to specific assets at an interior systems facility in the United Kingdom and specific assets at a powertrain systems facility in Austria. (ii) Restructuring Charges During 2008, we recorded restructuring and rationalization costs in North America of $79 million in cost of goods sold and $5 million in selling, general and administrative expense. These restructuring and rationalization costs were primarily recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008 and relate to: (i) the consolidation of interiors and exteriors operations in Canada and the United States; (ii) the closure of a seating systems facility in St. Louis, Missouri; (iii) the consolidation of closure systems operations in Canada; and (iv) the consolidation of our powertrain die casting operations in Canada and the United States. During 2008, we also incurred costs related to downsizing various operations. (2) Sale of Facility During 2009, we entered into an agreement to sell an engineering centre in Europe and, as a result, incurred a loss on disposition of the facility of $8 million. (3) Foreign Currency Gains In the normal course of business, we review our cash investment and tax planning strategies, including where such funds are invested. As a result of these reviews, during the third quarter of 2008 we repatriated funds from Europe and as a result recorded foreign currency gains of $116 million. (4) Income Taxes During the third quarter of 2008, we recorded a $123 million charge to establish valuation allowances against all of our future tax assets in the United States. The valuation allowances were required in the United States based on historical consolidated losses at our U.S. operations, that were expected to continue in the near-term, the accelerated deterioration of near-term automotive market conditions in the United States and the significant and inherent uncertainty as to the timing of when we would be able to generate the necessary level of earnings to recover these future tax assets. (5) Curtailment gain During the second quarter of 2009, we amended our Retiree Premium Reimbursement Plan in Canada and the United States, such that most employees retiring on or after August 1, 2009 will no longer participate in the plan. The amendment will reduce service costs and retirement medical benefit expense in 2009 and future years. As a result of amending the plan, a curtailment gain of $26 million was recorded in cost of goods sold in the second quarter of 2009. INDUSTRY TRENDS AND RISKS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- With the apparent stabilization and improvement in the global automotive industry in the second half of 2009, a number of the trends which impacted the industry and our business beginning in the second half of 2008 appear to be diminishing. For example, vehicle production levels, particularly in North America, appear to be improving as compared to the low levels experienced in the second half of 2008 and first half of 2009. However, forecast vehicle production levels in both North America and Europe for 2010 remain significantly below historic averages and remain sensitive to continued improvement in overall economic conditions. Similarly, while the short-term viability of several of our customers has improved due to significant government intervention and restructuring actions, the long-term viability of certain of our customers remains uncertain. Continued improvement in the global automotive industry is heavily dependent on factors such as consumer confidence, employment levels, household debt, real estate values, the continued availability of consumer credit, interest rates, energy prices and other factors. At this time, it is too early to determine whether the apparent stabilization and improvement in the economy and automotive industry in the second half of 2009 will continue. The impact of other recent trends also remains uncertain. For example, as a result of the restructuring of the global automotive industry in 2008/2009, the financial condition of the automotive supply base deteriorated significantly, with a number of suppliers restructuring while under bankruptcy protection or ceasing operations altogether. In the short-term, we have secured a significant amount of takeover business as our customers transferred business from weak suppliers to stronger suppliers. However, the mid to long- term impact of the restructuring of the automotive supply base cannot be determined at this time. Some of our competitors have successfully emerged from bankruptcy restructurings, leaving them with strong balance sheets, reduced cost structures and improved overall competitiveness. One recent and growing trend in the automotive industry, born out of the need to carefully manage costs, is the growth of cooperative alliances and arrangements among competing automotive OEMs. New and increasing relationships include features such as: shared purchasing of components; joint engine, powertrain and/or platform development; and engine, powertrain and platform sharing. Cooperation among competing OEMs is expected to increase, particularly with respect to vehicle hybridization and electrification, in order to lower the entry cost for OEMs to compete in these vehicle segments. A number of general trends which have been impacting the automotive industry in recent years are expected to continue, including: - the exertion of pricing pressure by OEMs;
 - government incentives and consumer demand for, and industry focus on,
 more fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly vehicles with
 alternative-energy fuel systems and additional safety features;
 - governmental regulation of fuel economy and emissions;
 - the long-term growth of the automotive industry in China, India,
 Brazil, Russia and other developing markets, including accelerated
 migration of component and vehicle design, development, engineering
 and manufacturing to certain of these markets;
 - the growth of the A to D vehicle segments (micro to mid-size cars),
 particularly in developing markets; and
 - the consolidation of vehicle platforms.
 The following are some of the more significant risks that could affect our ability to achieve our desired results: - The global automotive industry is cyclical and is sensitive to
 changes in economic and political conditions, including interest
 rates, energy prices and international conflicts. Commencing in the
 second half of 2008, the automotive industry experienced a more
 severe cyclical downturn than in prior cycles due to the disruption
 of global credit markets beginning in September 2008, the
 corresponding reduction in access to credit (particularly for
 purposes of vehicle financing), the deterioration of housing and
 equity markets and the resulting erosion in personal net worth, all
 of which led to extremely low consumer confidence, particularly in
 the U.S and which in turn, severely impacted automotive sales. While
 the global economy is currently showing signs of improvement,
 uncertainty remains. As a result of restructuring actions taken by
 OEMs and suppliers during the most recent cyclical downturn,
 automotive production levels are more closely aligned with actual
 automotive sales levels and, accordingly, are sensitive to overall
 economic conditions. The continuation of current or lower production
 volumes and sales levels for an extended period of time could have a
 material adverse effect on our profitability.
 - While the global economy is currently experiencing a gradual recovery
 and the condition of the global automotive industry appears to have
 stabilized and improved beginning in the latter half of 2009,
 considerable uncertainty remains as to the breadth and depth of a
 global economic and industry recovery, including the timing of a
 return to more normal market conditions. As a result of this
 continued uncertainty, we remain subject to considerable planning
 risk with respect to our business. A slower than anticipated recovery
 or a deterioration of economic conditions could have a material
 adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.
 - The short-term viability of several of our OEM customers appears to
 have improved as a result of restructuring actions in the past few
 years, as well as extraordinary levels of government financial
 intervention in the automotive industry, particularly in 2009.
 However, there can be no assurance that these restructuring actions
 will be successful in ensuring their long- term viability, nor can
 there be any assurance that government financial assistance will be
 made available at levels necessary to prevent OEM failures in the
 future. The bankruptcy of any of our major customers could have a
 material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.
 Additionally, since OEMs rely on a highly interdependent network of
 suppliers, an OEM bankruptcy could materially disrupt the supply
 chain, which could have a material adverse effect on our
 profitability and financial condition.
 - We rely on a number of suppliers to supply us with a wide range of
 components required in connection with our business. While the
 automotive supply base appears to be stabilizing following the severe
 cyclical downturn which commenced in the second half of 2008, the
 financial health of automotive suppliers is impacted by economic
 conditions, production volume cuts, intense pricing pressures and
 other factors. The insolvency or bankruptcy of a supplier could
 disrupt the supply of components to us or our customers, potentially
 causing the temporary shut-down of our or our customers' production
 lines. Any prolonged disruption in the supply of critical components
 to us or our customers, the inability to re source or insource
 production of a critical component from a financially distressed
 automotive components sub-supplier, or any temporary shut-down of one
 of our production lines or the production lines of one of our
 customers, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
 Additionally, the insolvency, bankruptcy or financial restructuring
 of any of our critical suppliers could result in us incurring
 unrecoverable costs related to the financial work-out of such
 suppliers and/or increased exposure for product liability, warranty
 or recall costs relating to the components supplied by such suppliers
 to the extent such supplier is not able to assume responsibility for
 such amounts, which could have an adverse effect on our
 profitability.
 - The automotive parts supply industry is highly competitive. As a
 result of our diversified automotive business, we face a number of
 competitors possessing varying degrees of financial and operational
 strength in each our of product and service capabilities. Some of our
 competitors have a substantially greater market share than us and are
 dominant in some of the markets in which we do business. In addition,
 recent restructuring actions taken by some of our competitors have
 provided them with improved financial and operational flexibility and
 could increase their competitive threat to our business, including
 increasing their market share at our expense. We may not be able to
 compete successfully with our existing competitors or with any new
 competitors, which could have an adverse effect on our operations and
 profitability.
 - We are dependent on the outsourcing of components, modules and
 assemblies, as well as complete vehicles, by OEMs. The extent of OEM
 outsourcing is influenced by a number of factors, including relative
 cost, quality and timeliness of production by suppliers as compared
 to OEMs, capacity utilization, labour relations among OEMs, their
 employees and unions and other considerations. As a result of lower
 cost structures due to recent restructuring actions, some OEMs may
 insource production which had previously been outsourced. Outsourcing
 of complete vehicle assembly is particularly dependent on the degree
 of unutilized capacity at the OEMs' own assembly facilities, in
 addition to the foregoing factors. A reduction in outsourcing by
 OEMs, or the loss of any material production or assembly programs
 coupled with the failure to secure alternative programs with
 sufficient volumes and margins, could have a material adverse effect
 on our profitability.
 - We continue to invest in technology and innovation, including certain
 alternative-energy technologies which we believe will be critical to
 our long-term growth. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology
 and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products
 on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to
 remain competitive. If there is a shift away from the use of
 technologies in which we are investing, our costs may not be fully
 recovered. In addition, if other technologies in which our investment
 is not as great or our expertise is not as developed emerge as the
 industry-leading technologies, we may be placed at a competitive
 disadvantage, which could have a material adverse effect on our
 profitability and financial condition.
 - As part of our strategy of continuously seeking to optimize our
 global manufacturing footprint, we may further rationalize some of
 our production facilities. In the course of such rationalization, we
 may incur further restructuring and/or downsizing costs related to
 plant closings, relocations and employee severance costs. Such costs
 could have an adverse effect on our short-term profitability. In
 addition, we are working to turn around financially underperforming
 divisions; however, there is no guarantee that we will be successful
 in doing so with respect to some or all such divisions.
 - We recorded significant impairment charges related to goodwill, long-
 lived assets and future tax assets in recent years and may continue
 to do so in the future. The bankruptcy of a significant customer or
 the early termination, loss, renegotiation of the terms of, or delay
 in the implementation of any significant production contract could be
 indicators of impairment. In addition, to the extent that forward-
 looking assumptions regarding the impact of improvement plans on
 current operations, insourcing and other new business opportunities,
 program price and cost assumptions on current and future business,
 the timing of new program launches and forecast production volumes
 are not met, any resulting impairment loss could have a material
 adverse effect on our profitability.
 - Although we supply parts to all of the leading OEMs, a significant
 majority of our sales are to six such customers. While we have
 diversified our customer base somewhat in recent years and continue
 to attempt to further diversify, particularly to increase our
 business with Asian-based OEMs, there is no assurance we will be
 successful. Our inability to successfully grow our sales to non-
 traditional customers could have a material adverse effect on our
 profitability.
 - While we supply parts for a wide variety of vehicles produced in
 North America and Europe, we do not supply parts for all vehicles
 produced, nor is the number or value of parts evenly distributed
 among the vehicles for which we do supply parts. Shifts in market
 share among vehicles (including shifts away from vehicles we assemble
 or shifts away from specific parts we produce) or the early
 termination, loss, renegotiation of the terms of, or delay in the
 implementation of any significant production or assembly contract
 could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
 - Many of our customers have sought, and will likely continue to seek
 to take advantage of lower operating costs in China, India, Brazil,
 Russia and other developing markets. While we continue to expand our
 manufacturing footprint with a view to taking advantage of
 manufacturing opportunities in these markets, we cannot guarantee
 that we will be able to fully realize such opportunities.
 Additionally, the establishment of manufacturing operations in
 developing market countries carries its own risks, including those
 relating to political and economic instability; trade, customs and
 tax risks; currency exchange rates; currency controls; insufficient
 infrastructure; and other risks associated with conducting business
 internationally. The inability to quickly adjust our manufacturing
 footprint to take advantage of manufacturing opportunities in these
 markets could harm our ability to compete with other suppliers
 operating in or from such markets, which could have an adverse effect
 on our profitability.
 - Recently, several major financial institutions failed or required
 massive government intervention in order to prevent collapse. The
 turmoil in the financial sector significantly affected the global
 economy, and contributed to a global recession. While financial
 markets appear to have stabilized, the failure of any major financial
 institutions in the future could lead to significant disruptions in
 capital and credit markets and could adversely affect our and our
 customers' ability to access needed liquidity for working capital. In
 addition, in the event of a failure of a financial institution; in
 which we invest our cash reserves; that is a counterparty in a
 derivative transaction with us; or a lender to us, we face the risk
 that that our cash reserves and amounts owing to us pursuant to
 derivative transactions may not be fully recoverable, or the amount
 of credit available to us may be significantly reduced. All of these
 risks could have an impact on our financial condition.
 - Although our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a
 significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in
 Canadian dollars, euros, British pounds and other currencies. Our
 profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against the
 Canadian dollar, the euro, the British pound and other currencies in
 which we generate revenues and incur expenses. However, as a result
 of hedging programs employed by us, foreign currency transactions are
 not fully impacted by movements in exchange rates. We record foreign
 currency transactions at the hedged rate where applicable. Despite
 these measures, significant long-term fluctuations in relative
 currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative
 values of the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, euro or British pound,
 could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial
 condition and any sustained change in such related currency values
 could adversely impact our competitiveness in certain geographic
 regions.
 - We have completed a number of significant acquisitions in recent
 years and may continue to do so in the future. In those product areas
 in which we have identified acquisitions as critical to our business
 strategy, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition targets
 or successfully acquire any suitable targets which we identify.
 Additionally, we may not be able to successfully integrate or achieve
 anticipated synergies from those acquisitions which we do complete
 and such failure could have a material adverse effect on our
 profitability.
 - We face significant pricing pressure, as well as pressure to absorb
 costs related to product design, engineering and tooling, as well as
 other items previously paid for directly by OEMs. These pressures are
 expected to continue, even as the industry begins to recover from the
 global recession. The continuation or intensification of these
 pricing pressures and pressure to absorb costs could have an adverse
 effect on our profitability.
 - Our customers continue to demand that we bear the cost of the repair
 and replacement of defective products which are either covered under
 their warranty or are the subject of a recall by them. Warranty
 provisions are established based on our best estimate of the amounts
 necessary to settle existing or probable claims on product defect
 issues. Recall costs are costs incurred when government regulators
 and/or our customers decide to recall a product due to a known or
 suspected performance issue and we are required to participate either
 voluntarily or involuntarily. Currently, under most customer
 agreements, we only account for existing or probable warranty claims.
 Under certain complete vehicle engineering and assembly contracts, we
 record an estimate of future warranty-related costs based on the
 terms of the specific customer agreements and the specific customer's
 warranty experience. The obligation to repair or replace such
 products could have a material adverse effect on our profitability
 and financial condition if the actual costs are materially different
 from our estimates.
 - From time to time, we may become liable for legal, contractual and
 other claims by various parties, including customers, suppliers,
 former employees, class action plaintiffs and others. On an on going
 basis, we attempt to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments
 or outcomes to these claims, although it is difficult to predict
 final outcomes with any degree of certainty. At this time, we do not
 believe that any of the claims to which we are party will have a
 material adverse effect on our financial position; however, we cannot
 provide any assurance to this effect. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Average Foreign Exchange

 The preceding table reflects the average foreign exchange rates between the most common currencies in which we conduct business and our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The significant changes in these foreign exchange rates for the three months and year ended December 31, 2009 impacted the reported U.S. dollar amounts of our sales, expenses and income. The results of operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates in the table above for the relevant period. Throughout this MD&A, reference is made to the impact of translation of foreign operations on reported U.S. dollar amounts where relevant. Our results can also be affected by the impact of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency transactions (such as raw material purchases or sales denominated in foreign currencies). However, as a result of hedging programs employed by us, foreign currency transactions in the current period have not been fully impacted by movements in exchange rates. We record foreign currency transactions at the hedged rate where applicable. Finally, holding gains and losses on foreign currency denominated monetary items, which are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, impact reported results.

 External Production Sales - North America External production sales in North America decreased 31% or $3.4 billion to $7.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $10.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease in production sales reflects a 32% decrease in North American vehicle production volumes partially offset by a 1% increase in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. More importantly, during 2009 our largest customers in North America continued to reduce vehicle production volumes compared to 2008. While North American vehicle production volumes declined 32% in 2009 compared to 2008, Chrysler and GM vehicle production declined 48% and 44%, respectively. On a positive note, Ford's vehicle production decline was only 16%. Our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 1% or $5 to $872 for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $867 for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to 2008, including
 the:
 - Ford F-Series and Lincoln Mark LT;
 - Chevrolet Traverse;
 - Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain; and
 - Chevrolet Camaro;
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or increased
 content on certain programs, including the:
 - Ford Escape, Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute; and
 - Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan and Lincoln MKZ;
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to 2008, including
 - a substantial portion of Plastech Engineered Products Inc.'s
 exteriors business (""Plastech"");
 - Meridian; and
 - a stamping and sub-assembly facility in Alabama from Ogihara
 America Corporation; and
 - takeover business that launched during or subsequent to 2008.
 These factors were partially offset by: - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or lower
 content on certain programs, including the:
 - Chevrolet Cobalt;
 - Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and Volkswagen
 Routan;
 - Chrysler 300 and 300C and Dodge Charger; and
 - Buick Enclave and GMC Acadia;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to 2008,
 including the:
 - Saturn Vue, Aura and Outlook;
 - Chevrolet Trailblazer and GMC Envoy; and
 - Pontiac G5, G6, Solstice, Sky and GT;
 - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the
 Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar; and
 - customer price concessions during or subsequent to 2008.
 External Production Sales - Europe External production sales in Europe decreased 17% or $1.2 billion to $5.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $7.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease in production sales reflects a 19% decrease in European vehicle production volumes partially offset by a 2% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. Our average dollar content per vehicle increased by 2% or $9 to $495 for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $486 for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to 2008, including
 the:
 - Audi Q5;
 - Volkswagen Golf;
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Opel/Vauxhall Insignia;
 - BMW One/Cooper Convertible; and
 - Volkswagen A5 Cabrio and Sportback; and
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to 2008, including
 Cadence.
 These factors were partially offset by: - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or lower
 content on certain programs, including the:
 - Mercedes-Benz C-Class;
 - Porsche Cayenne and Volkswagen Touareg;
 - Volkswagen Transporter;
 - BMW X3;
 - Ford Transit;
 - Opel/Vauxhall Vivaro, Nissan Primastar and Renault Trafic;
 - Opel Astra;
 - Audi Q7; and
 - Honda Civic;
 - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the
 euro and British pound, each against the U.S. dollar;
 - the sale of certain facilities during or subsequent to 2008; and
 - customer price concessions during or subsequent to 2008.
 External Production Sales - Rest of World External production sales in Rest of World increased 31% or $161 million to $676 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $515 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of: - increased production and/or content on certain programs in China and
 Brazil;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to 2008 in China and
 Japan; and
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales as a result of the
 strengthening of the Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. dollar.
 These factors were partially offset by: - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales as a result of the weakening
 of the Brazilian real, Korean Won and South African Rand, each
 against the U.S. dollar; and
 - decreased production and/or content on certain programs, particularly
 in South Africa.
 Complete Vehicle Assembly Sales The terms of our various vehicle assembly contracts differ with respect to the ownership of components and supplies related to the assembly process and the method of determining the selling price to the OEM customer. Under certain contracts we are acting as principal and purchased components and systems in assembled vehicles are included in our inventory and cost of sales. These costs are reflected on a full cost basis in the selling price of the final assembled vehicle to the OEM customer. Other contracts provide that third-party components and systems are held on consignment by us, and the selling price to the OEM customer reflects a value added assembly fee only. Production levels of the various vehicles assembled by us have an impact on the level of our sales and profitability. In addition, the relative proportion of programs accounted for on a full cost basis and programs accounted for on a value added basis also impacts our level of sales and operating margin percentage, but may not necessarily affect our overall level of profitability. Assuming no change in total vehicles assembled, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a full cost basis has the effect of increasing the level of total sales, however, because purchased components are included in cost of sales, profitability as a percentage of total sales is reduced. Conversely, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a value added basis has the effect of reducing the level of total sales and increasing profitability as a percentage of total sales.

 Complete vehicle assembly sales decreased 47% or $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 while assembly volumes decreased 55% or 68,816 units. The decrease in complete vehicle assembly volumes is due to a combination of general economic conditions as discussed previously; the natural decline in volumes as certain models that we currently assemble approach their scheduled end of production; and a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. However, the Peugeot RCZ launched in the fourth quarter of 2009 and several new complete vehicle assembly programs have been awarded and are scheduled to launch throughout 2010 to 2013. Tooling, Engineering and Other Tooling, engineering and other sales decreased 16% or $0.3 billion to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. In the year ended December 31, 2009, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - MINI Cooper, Clubman and Crossman;
 - Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra;
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Opel/Vauxhall Astra;
 - Audi Q5;
 - BMW X3;
 - Porsche Boxster and Cayman;
 - Porsche Cayenne;
 - Mercedes-Benz M-Class;
 - Peugeot RCZ;
 - Cadillac SRX and Saab 9-4X;
 - Ford F-Series; and
 - Mercedes-Benz C-Class.
 In the year ended December 31, 2008, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - MINI Cooper, Clubman and Crossman;
 - BMW Z4, X3 and 1-Series;
 - GM's full-size pickups;
 - Cadillac SRX and Saab 9-4X;
 - Mazda 6;
 - Porsche 911 / Boxster;
 - Mercedes-Benz M-Class;
 - Chevrolet Equinox, Pontiac Torrent and Suzuki XL7;
 - Ford F-Series;
 - Lincoln MKS; and
 - Audi A5.
 In addition, tooling, engineering and other sales decreased as a result of the weakening of the euro and Canadian dollar, each against the U.S. dollar. Gross Margin Gross margin decreased $1.0 billion to $1.7 billion for 2009 compared to $2.7 billion for 2008 while gross margin as a percentage of total sales decreased to 9.6% for 2009 compared to 11.5% for 2008. The unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section negatively impacted gross margin as a percentage of total sales in 2008 by 0.3%. Excluding unusual items, gross margin as a percentage of total sales decreased by 2.2%. ""Significant Items"" also negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $125 million and $70 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, gross margin as a percentage of total sales was negatively impacted by: - lower gross margin earned due to the significant decline in vehicle
 production volumes;
 - costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches primarily in
 Europe;
 - electric vehicle development costs;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities;
 - a favourable revaluation of warranty accruals during 2008;
 - costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics capabilities;
 - additional supplier insolvency costs;
 - increased commodity costs; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2008.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives (including employee reductions, short work week
 schedules and benefit plan changes) undertaken during or subsequent
 to 2008;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - a decrease in complete vehicle assembly sales which have a lower
 gross margin than our consolidated average;
 - no employee profit sharing for 2009; and
 - the decrease in tooling and other sales that earn low or no margins.
 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization costs decreased 16% or $136 million to $737 million for 2009 compared to $873 million for 2008. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily as a result of: - the impairment of certain assets during 2008, in particular at a
 powertrain systems facility in the United States and certain
 interiors and exteriors systems facilities in North America;
 - the sale or disposition of certain facilities during or subsequent to
 2008; and
 - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar depreciation and amortization due
 to the weakening of the Canadian dollar and euro, each against the
 U.S. dollar.
 These factors were partially offset by acquisitions and capital spending during or subsequent to 2008. Selling, General and Administrative (""SG&A"") SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 7.3% for 2009, compared to 5.6% for 2008. The unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section negatively impacted SG&A as a percentage of total sales in 2009 by 0.1% and positively impacted SG&A as a percentage of total sales in 2008 by 0.4%. Excluding these unusual items, SG&A as a percentage of total sales increased 1.2%. SG&A expense decreased 4% or $58 million to $1.26 billion for 2009 compared to $1.32 billion for 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2009 and 2008 (as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section), SG&A expenses decreased by $180 million. ""Significant Items"" also negatively impacted SG&A by approximately $95 million and $15 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, SG&A was positively impacted by: - cost saving initiatives, including reduced discretionary spending,
 employee reductions, reduced bonuses, voluntary wage reductions and
 benefit plan changes;
 - reduced spending at certain facilities as a result of restructuring
 and downsizing activities that were initiated during or subsequent
 to 2008;
 - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar SG&A expense due to the weakening
 of the Canadian dollar and euro, each against the U.S. dollar; and
 - the sale or disposition of certain facilities during or subsequent to
 2008.
 These factors were partially offset by acquisitions completed during or subsequent to 2008, including Cadence. Impairment Charges Impairment charges decreased $100 million to $183 million for 2009 compared to $283 million for 2008 as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) EBIT is defined as income (loss) from operations before income taxes as presented on our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements before net interest expense (income). North America EBIT in North America decreased $7 million to a loss of $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to a loss of $106 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Excluding the North American unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $273 million decrease in EBIT was substantially due to decreased margins earned on reduced sales as a result of significantly lower vehicle production volumes. ""Significant Items"" including, downsizing and other restructuring activities; accelerated amortization of deferred wage buydown assets; and settlement on research and development incentives also negatively impacted EBIT in North America by approximately $85 million and $40 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, EBIT was negatively impacted by: - electric vehicle development costs;
 - additional supplier insolvency costs;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics capabilities;
 - higher warranty costs; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2008.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives (including reduced discretionary spending,
 employee reductions, reduced bonuses, and benefit plan changes)
 undertaken during or subsequent to 2008;
 - lower affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - no employee profit sharing for 2009;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities; and
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition from Plastech.
 Europe EBIT in Europe decreased $656 million to a loss of $415 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to earnings of $241 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Excluding the European unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $566 million decrease in EBIT was substantially due to decreased margins earned on reduced sales as a result of significantly lower vehicle production volumes. ""Significant Items"" including, downsizing and other restructuring activities; accounts receivable valuation allowances; write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related to the cancelation of an assembly program; and costs related to the delay in the start of production in a program also negatively impacted EBIT in Europe by approximately $110 million and $5 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, EBIT was negatively impacted by: - costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches or for programs
 that have not fully ramped up production;
 - costs incurred at new facilities in Russia as we continue to pursue
 opportunities in this market;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities;
 - a favourable revaluation of warranty accruals during 2008;
 - costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics capabilities; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2008.
 These factors were partially offset by: - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence;
 - lower affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - the benefit of cost saving initiatives, including reduced
 discretionary spending, employee reductions, short work week
 schedules, reduced bonuses and voluntary wage reductions;
 - lower commodity costs; and
 - the sale of certain underperforming divisions during or subsequent to
 2008.
 Rest of World EBIT in Rest of World increased $11 million to $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of incremental margin earned on new programs that launched during or subsequent to 2008 in China partially offset by costs incurred at new facilities, substantially in India and Japan. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other EBIT decreased $118 million to a loss of $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to earnings of $99 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Excluding the Corporate and Other unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, EBIT decreased by $2 million. ""Significant Items"" including, due diligence costs associated with our planned investment in Opel, which terminated during the fourth quarter of 2009; adjustments of our investment in ABCP; and other losses on disposal of assets also negatively impacted EBIT in Corporate and Other by approximately $25 million and $40 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, EBIT was negatively impacted by: - a decrease in affiliation fees earned from our divisions; and
 - a decrease in equity income earned.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the benefit of cost saving initiatives, including reduced
 discretionary spending, employee reductions, short work week
 schedules, reduced bonuses, voluntary wage reductions and benefit
 plan changes;
 - decreased executive compensation;
 - costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to electric
 vehicle development; and
 - lower charitable and social contributions.
 Interest Expense (Income), net During 2009, we recorded net interest expense of $7 million, compared to $62 million of net interest income for 2008. The $69 million decrease in net interest income is as a result of: - a decrease in interest income earned on lower cash and cash
 equivalent balances;
 - a decrease in interest income earned due to lower interest rates; and
 - an increase in interest expense paid on higher short-term borrowings.
 These factors were partially offset by a reduction in interest expense on long-term debt due to the repayment of our senior unsecured notes and 7.08% Subordinated Debentures. Operating Income (Loss) Operating income decreased $839 million to a loss of $511 million for 2009 compared to income of $328 million for 2008. Excluding the unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, operating income for 2009 decreased $899 million. The decrease in operating income is the result of the decreases in EBIT (including the approximately $145 million of additional ""Significant Items"" in 2009) and net interest income earned, both as discussed above. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate on operating income (excluding equity income) for 2009 and 2008 was significantly impacted by the unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section. Excluding unusual items, our effective income tax rate changed to a recovery of 6.7% for 2009 compared to an expense of 34.8% for 2008. The change in the effective income tax rate is primarily the result of an increase in losses not benefited primarily in Germany and Austria. Net Income (Loss) Net income decreased $564 million to a net loss of $493 million for 2009 compared to net income of $71 million for 2008. Excluding the unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income decreased $682 million. This decrease in net income is the result of the decrease in operating income partially offset by lower income taxes, both as discussed above. Earnings (Loss) per Share For the year

Excluding the unusual items, discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, diluted earnings per share decreased $6.04 from 2008 as a result of a decrease in net income (excluding unusual items) described above and a decrease in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during 2009. The decrease in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to the effect of the repurchase and cancelation of our Class A Subordinate Voting Shares in 2008 under the terms of our Normal Course Issuer Bid and a decrease in the number of diluted shares associated with restricted stock and stock options since such shares were anti-dilutive in 2009.

 Cash flow from operations before changes in non-cash operating assets and liabilities decreased $708 million to $621 million for 2009 compared to $1.3 billion for 2008. The decrease in cash flow from operations was primarily due to the $564 million decrease in net income, as discussed above, and a $223 million decrease in non-cash unusual items, $136 million reduction in depreciation and amortization offset in part by a $187 million increase in future taxes. Cash invested in non-cash operating assets and liabilities amounted to $94 million for 2009 compared to $275 million for 2008. The change in non-cash operating assets and liabilities is comprised of the following sources (and uses) of cash: For the year

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Changes in non-cash operating assets and liabilities $ (94) $ (275)
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable in 2009 was primarily due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in inventories relates to several tooling programs in North America and Europe and depletion of production inventory builds due to increased production volumes. The increase in income taxes receivable was primarily due to losses that are being carried back to prior years and higher refunds in North America. The decrease in other accrued liabilities is primarily a result of the payments during 2009 of restructuring costs that were accrued as at December 31, 2008.

 Fixed and other assets additions In 2009, we invested $629 million in fixed assets. While investments were made to refurbish or replace assets consumed in the normal course of business and for productivity improvements, a large portion of the investment in 2009 was for manufacturing equipment for programs that will be launching subsequent to 2009. In 2009, we invested $227 million in other assets related substantially to fully reimbursable planning and engineering and tooling costs at our complete vehicle engineering and assembly operations and our roof systems operations for programs that will be launching subsequent to 2009. Purchase of subsidiaries During 2009, we invested $50 million to purchase subsidiaries, including the acquisition of: - Cadence, a manufacturer of exterior and interior systems. The
 acquired business is primarily located in the Czech Republic with
 sales to various customers, including Skoda; and
 - several facilities from Meridian. The facilities are located in the
 United States and Mexico and manufacture composites for various
 customers.
 During 2008, we invested $158 million to purchase subsidiaries, including the acquisition of: - a facility from Ogihara America Corporation;
 - a substantial portion of the exteriors business and related assets
 from Plastech;
 - BluWav Systems LLC; and
 - Technoplast.
 Proceeds from disposition Proceeds from disposition in 2009 and 2008 were $30 million and $65 million, respectively, which represent normal course fixed and other asset disposals. Financing For the year

 In December 2008, in response to the uncertainty related to the financial viability of some of our key customers in North America, we drew down on our term and operating lines of credit. In February and March 2009, as the situation facing some of our key customers became clearer, we repaid $767 million of the outstanding lines of credit. The repayments of debt in 2009 consists primarily of the repayment of our 7.08% Subordinated Debentures in September 2009 and our 6.5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures in December 2009. During 2009, cash dividends of $21 million were paid on the Class A Subordinate Voting or Class B Shares in the first quarter of 2009. This compares to cash dividends of $140 million in 2008. During the second quarter of 2009, our Board of Directors suspended payment of dividends and, as a result, no cash dividends were paid on our Class A Subordinate Voting or Class B Shares for the remainder of 2009.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Total capitalization decreased by $1.03 billion to $7.54 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to $8.57 billion at December 31, 2008. The decrease in capitalization was a result of a $1.03 billion decrease in liabilities. The decrease in liabilities is primarily as a result of a $767 million repayment on our outstanding lines of credit in the first quarter of 2009, the repayment of our 7.08% Subordinated Debentures during the third quarter of 2009 and the repayment of our 6.5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures during the fourth quarter of 2009. These decreases were partially offset by debt assumed on the acquisition of Cadence. The decrease in shareholders' equity was primarily as a result of: - the net loss incurred during 2009; and
 - dividends paid during the first quarter of 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by: - a $407 million increase in accumulated net unrealized gains on
 translation of our net investment in foreign operations, primarily
 as a result of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, euro and
 British pound, each against the U.S. dollar between December 31,
 2008 and December 31, 2009; and
 - net unrealized gains on cash flow hedges and the reclassification of
 net losses on cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive
 income to net loss.
 Cash Resources During 2009, our cash resources decreased by $1.4 billion to $1.3 billion primarily as a result of the net repayment of $0.9 billion on our outstanding lines of credit, cash used in investing activities, the repayment of our 7.08% Subordinated Debentures and the repayment of our 6.5% Convertible Subordinate Debentures, all as discussed previously. In addition to our cash resources, we had term and operating lines of credit totalling $2.1 billion. The unused and available portion of our lines of credit increased $0.9 billion to $1.9 billion during 2009 due to the net repayment on our operating lines. In addition, at December 31, 2009, we held Canadian third party ABCP with a face value of Cdn$134 million and a carrying value of Cdn$88 million, which was based on a valuation technique that estimates the fair value based on relevant current market indices for instruments of comparable credit quality, term and structure (""current market indices""). During 2009, we recorded a $9 million increase in the carrying value of our investment in ABCP due to a tightening of the spread between the anticipated return on the restructured notes and the current market indices.

 Our off balance sheet financing arrangements are limited to operating lease contracts. The majority of our facilities are subject to operating leases with MID or with third parties. Operating lease payments in 2009 for facilities leased from MID and third parties were $149 million and $131 million, respectively. Operating lease commitments in 2010 for facilities leased from MID and third parties are expected to be $150 million and $128 million, respectively. Our existing leases with MID generally provide for periodic rent escalations based either on fixed-rate step increases, or on the basis of a consumer price index adjustment (subject to certain caps). We also have operating lease commitments for equipment. These leases are generally of shorter duration. Operating lease payments for equipment were $42 million for 2009, and are expected to be $41 million in 2010. Although our consolidated contractual annual lease commitments decline year by year, we expect that existing leases will either be renewed or replaced, or alternatively, we will incur capital expenditures to acquire equivalent capacity. Foreign Currency Activities Our North American operations negotiate sales contracts with OEMs for payment in both U.S. and Canadian dollars. Materials and equipment are purchased in various currencies depending upon competitive factors, including relative currency values. The North American operations use labour and materials which are paid for in both U.S. and Canadian dollars. Our Mexican operations generally use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. Our European operations negotiate sales contracts with OEMs for payment principally in euros and British pounds. The European operations' material, equipment and labour are paid for principally in euros and British pounds. We employ hedging programs, primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts, in an effort to manage our foreign exchange exposure, which arises when manufacturing facilities have committed to the delivery of products for which the selling price has been quoted in foreign currencies. These commitments represent our contractual obligations to deliver products over the duration of the product programs, which can last a number of years. The amount and timing of the forward contracts will be dependent upon a number of factors, including anticipated production delivery schedules and anticipated production costs, which may be paid in the foreign currency. In addition, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign exchange exposure with respect to internal funding arrangements. Despite these measures, significant long term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative values of the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, euro or British pound, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition (as discussed throughout this MD&A). RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- FINANCIAL RESULTS SUMMARY ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the fourth quarter of 2009, we posted sales of $5.4 billion, an increase of 12% from the fourth quarter of 2008. This higher sales level was a result of increases in our North American, European and Rest of World production sales and complete vehicle assembly sales offset in part by a decrease in tooling, engineering and other sales. Comparing the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2008: - North American average dollar content per vehicle decreased 1%, while
 vehicle production increased 2%;
 - European average dollar content per vehicle increased 20%, and
 vehicle production increased 13%; and
 - Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 7% to $512 million from
 $479 million while complete vehicle assembly volumes declined 6%.
 During the fourth quarter of 2009, we generated an operating loss of $125 million compared to an operating loss of $165 million for 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, operating income increased by $80 million. Included in operating income for the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008 are several ""Significant Items"" that impact operating income representing approximately $130 million and $20 million, respectively. ""Significant Items"" consist primarily of: - downsizing and other restructuring activities that have not been
 included in the ""Unusual Items"" section;
 - an accounts receivable valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of
 2009;
 - due diligence costs associated with our planned investment in Opel,
 which terminated during the fourth quarter of 2009;
 - the write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related
 to the cancelation of an assembly program in the fourth quarter of
 2009;
 - costs related to the delay in the start of production of a program;
 and
 - other losses on disposal of assets.
 During the fourth quarter of 2009, net loss was $139 million compared to net loss of $148 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income for the fourth quarter 2009 increased $71 million. The increase in net income was a result of the increase in operating income partially offset by higher income taxes. During the fourth quarter of 2009, our diluted loss per share was $1.25 compared to diluted loss per share of $1.33 for the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, diluted loss per share for 2009 decreased $0.63. The decrease in diluted loss per share is primarily as a result of the increase in net income, excluding unusual items. For the three months

 External Production Sales - North America External production sales in North America increased 1% or $24 million to $2.42 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $2.39 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase in production sales reflects a 2% increase in North American vehicle production volumes partially offset by a 1% decrease in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. Our average dollar content per vehicle declined by 1% or $6 to $868 for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $874 for the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of: - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or lower
 content on certain programs, including the:
 - GM full-sized pickups;
 - Chevrolet Cobalt;
 - GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave;
 - Chevrolet Impala;
 - Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and Volkswagen
 Routan;
 - Chevrolet HHR;
 - Mazda 6;
 - Dodge Ram; and
 - Chrysler 300 and 300C and Dodge Charger; and
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the fourth
 quarter of 2008, including the:
 - Pontiac G5, G6, Solstice, Sky and GT;
 - Chevrolet Trailblazer, GMC Envoy and Saab 9-7X; and
 - Saturn Vue, Aura and Outlook; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the fourth quarter of
 2008.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the fourth quarter
 of 2008, including the:
 - Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Terrain, Pontiac Torrent and Suzuki XL7;
 - Cadillac SRX; and
 - Chevrolet Camaro;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening
 of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar;
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or increased
 content on certain programs, including the:
 - Ford Escape, Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute; and
 - Ford F-Series and Lincoln Mark LT;
 - takeover business that launched subsequent to the fourth quarter
 of 2008; and
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to the fourth quarter
 of 2008, including several facilities from Meridian.
 External Production Sales - Europe External production sales in Europe increased 35% or $450 million to $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase in production sales reflects a 13% increase in European vehicle production volumes as discussed in the ""Highlights"" section combined with a 20% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. Our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 20% or $87 to $523 for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $436 for the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily as a result of: - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening of
 the euro and British pound, each against the U.S. dollar;
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to the fourth quarter of
 2008, including Cadence; and
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the fourth quarter
 of 2008, including the:
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Skoda Yeti;
 - MINI Cooper Convertible; and
 - Audi A5 Cabrio and Sportback;
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or increased
 content on certain programs, including the Audi Q5.
 These factors were partially offset by: - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or lower
 content on certain programs, including the:
 - Volkswagen Transporter;
 - Smart fortwo;
 - Mercedes-Benz C-Class;
 - BMW X3;
 - Mercedes-Benz B-Class and B-Class Fuel Cell; and
 - Volkswagen Tiguan;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the fourth
 quarter of 2008, including the GAZ Siber; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the fourth quarter of
 2008.
 External Production Sales - Rest of World External production sales in Rest of World increased 115% or $118 million to $221 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $103 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of: - increased production and/or content on certain programs in China,
 Korea and Brazil;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the fourth quarter
 of 2008 in China and Japan; and
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales as a result of the
 weakening of the Brazilian real and Korean won, each against the
 U.S. dollar.
 Complete Vehicle Assembly Sales For the three months
 ended December 31,

 Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 7% or $33 million to $512 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $479 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 and assembly volumes decreased 6% or 1,081 units. The higher sales level is primarily as a result of an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar partially offset by the decrease in complete vehicle assembly volumes due to the natural decline in volumes as certain models that we currently assemble approach their scheduled end of production. However, the Peugeot RCZ launched in the fourth quarter of 2009 and several new complete vehicle assembly programs have been awarded and are scheduled to launch throughout 2010 to 2013. Tooling, Engineering and Other Tooling, engineering and other sales decreased 7% or $42 million to $547 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $589 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - Audi Q5;
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Porsche Boxster and Cayman;
 - Mercedes-Benz M-Class;
 - Porsche Cayenne;
 - Peugeot RCZ;
 - MINI Cooper, Clubman and Crossman;
 - Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra;
 - BMW X3; and
 - Mercedes-Benz E-Class.
 In the fourth quarter of 2008, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - MINI Cooper, Clubman and Crossman;
 - BMW Z4, X3 and 1-Series;
 - GM's full-size pickups;
 - Cadillac SRX and Saab 9-4X;
 - Mercedes-Benz M-Class;
 - Porsche 911 / Boxster;
 - Ford Fusion;
 - Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300; and
 - Chevrolet Camaro.
 In addition, tooling, engineering and other sales increased as a result of the strengthening of the euro and Canadian dollar, each against the U.S. dollar.

 North America EBIT in North America increased $175 million to $84 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to a loss of $91 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the North American unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, EBIT increased $121 million. ""Significant Items"" including, downsizing and other restructuring activities also negatively impacted EBIT in North America by approximately $25 million and $15 million in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives (including reduced discretionary spending,
 employee reductions, reduced bonuses, and benefit plan changes)
 undertaken during or subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2008;
 - roductivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - lower affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - no employee profit sharing for the fourth quarter of 2009;
 - lower commodity costs; and
 - incremental margin earned from acquisitions completed subsequent to
 the fourth quarter of 2008.
 These factors were partially offset by: - higher warranty costs;
 - electric vehicle development costs;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the fourth quarter of
 2008.
 Europe EBIT in Europe decreased $127 million to a loss of $202 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to a loss of $75 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the European unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, EBIT decreased by $33 million. ""Significant Items"" including, downsizing and other restructuring activities; accounts receivable valuation allowances; write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related to the cancelation of an assembly program; and costs related to the delay in the start of production in a program also negatively impacted EBIT in Europe by approximately $70 million and $5 million in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - lower commodity costs;
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence
 during the second quarter of 2009;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - lower incentive compensation; and
 - the benefit of cost saving initiatives, including reduced
 discretionary spending, employee reductions, short work week
 schedules, reduced bonuses, and voluntary wage reductions.
 These factors were partially offset by: - costs incurred at new facilities in Russia as we continue to pursue
 opportunities in this market;
 - costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics capabilities;
 - costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches or for programs
 that have not fully ramped up production;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities;
 - higher warranty costs; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the fourth quarter of
 2008.
 Rest of World Rest of World EBIT increased $15 million to $18 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $3 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of incremental margin earned on new programs that launched during or subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2008 in China partially offset by costs incurred at new facilities, primarily in Japan. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other EBIT decreased $10 million to a loss of $26 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to a loss of $16 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. ""Significant Items"" including, due diligence costs associated with our planned investment in Opel, which terminated during the fourth quarter of 2009; and other losses on disposal also negatively impacted EBIT in Corporate and Other by approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to electric
 vehicle development;
 - an increase in equity income earned; and
 - the benefit of cost saving initiatives, including reduced
 discretionary spending, employee reductions, voluntary wage
 reductions and benefit plan changes.
 These factors were partially offset by a decrease in affiliation fees earned from our divisions. FUTURE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Conversion to International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") in Fiscal 2011 In February 2008, the Canadian Accounting Standards Board confirmed the transition from Canadian GAAP to IFRS for all publicly accountable entities no later than fiscal years commencing on or after January 1, 2011. As a result, throughout 2009, we undertook a detailed review of the implications of having to report under IFRS and also examined the alternative available to us, as a Foreign Private Issuer in the United States, of filing our primary financial statements in Canada using U.S. GAAP, as permitted by the Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 51-102, ""Continuous Disclosure Obligations"". In carrying out this evaluation, we considered many factors, including, but not limited to (i) the changes in accounting policies that would be required and the resulting impact on our reported results and key performance indicators, (ii) the reporting standards expected to be used by many of our industry comparables, and (iii) the financial reporting needs of our market participants, including shareholders, lenders, rating agencies and market analysts. As a result of this analysis, we have determined that we will adopt U.S. GAAP as our primary basis of financial reporting with our first reporting period beginning after January 1, 2011. We have already commenced planning and implementation of this transition and the adoption of U.S. GAAP is not anticipated to have a material change on our accounting policies or financial results, except for the reporting differences disclosed in note 26 of our 2008 consolidated financial statements. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- From time to time, we may be contingently liable for litigation and other claims. Refer to note 24 of our 2008 audited consolidated financial statements, which describes these claims. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- The previous discussion contains statements that constitute ""forward- looking statements"" within the meaning of applicable securities legislation, including, but not limited to, statements relating to growth in global and North American vehicle production; growth prospects in the Western European market; the potential for future growth in, and impact on our earnings of, our current and future investments in electronics and hybrid/electric vehicles; future growth prospects of our business; and the timing of launch of new complete vehicle assembly programs. The forward-looking information in this MD&A is presented for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward-looking statements may include financial and other projections, as well as statements regarding our future plans, objectives or economic performance, or the assumptions underlying any of the foregoing, and other statements that are not recitations of historical fact. We use words such as ""may"", ""would"", ""could"", ""should"", ""will"", ""likely"", ""expect"", ""anticipate"", ""believe"", ""intend"", ""plan"", ""forecast"", ""outlook"", ""project"", ""estimate"" and similar expressions suggesting future outcomes or events to identify forward-looking statements. Any such forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and are based on assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and our perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors we believe are appropriate in the circumstances. However, whether actual results and developments will conform with our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks, assumptions and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and the effects of which can be difficult to predict, including, without limitation: the potential for a slower than anticipated economic recovery or a deterioration of economic conditions; low production volumes and sales levels; the financial condition and credit worthiness of some of our OEM customers, including the potential that such customers may not make, or may seek to delay or reduce, payments owed to us; the financial condition of some of our suppliers and the risk of their insolvency, bankruptcy or financial restructuring; the highly competitive nature of the automotive parts supply business; our dependence on outsourcing by our customers; the termination or non renewal by our customers of any material contracts; our ability to identify and successfully exploit shifts in technology; restructuring, downsizing and/or other significant non- recurring costs; impairment charges; our ability to successfully grow our sales to non-traditional customers; unfavourable product or customer mix; risks of conducting business in foreign countries, including China, India, Brazil, Russia and other developing markets; our ability to quickly shift our manufacturing footprint to take advantage of lower cost manufacturing opportunities; disruptions in the capital and credit markets; fluctuations in relative currency values; our ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions; pricing pressures, including our ability to offset price concessions demanded by our customers; warranty and recall costs; product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage; changes in our mix of earnings between jurisdictions with lower tax rates and those with higher tax rates, as well as our ability to fully benefit tax losses; other potential tax exposures; legal claims against us; work stoppages and labour relations disputes; changes in laws and governmental regulations; costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations; potential conflicts of interest involving our indirect controlling shareholder, the Stronach Trust; and other factors set out in our Annual Information Form filed with securities commissions in Canada and our annual report on Form 40-F filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and subsequent filings. In evaluating forward-looking statements, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements and readers should specifically consider the various factors which could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. Unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, we do not intend, nor do we undertake any obligation, to update or revise any forward- looking statements to reflect subsequent information, events, results or circumstances or otherwise.

 See accompanying notes MAGNA INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Unaudited)(All amounts in U.S. dollars and all tabular amounts in millions unlessotherwise noted) ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Magna International Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively ""Magna"" or the ""Company"") have been prepared in United States dollars following Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") with respect to the preparation of interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required in the preparation of annual financial statements and therefore should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2008 audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's 2008 Annual Report. These interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the same accounting policies as the December 31, 2008 annual consolidated financial statements, except the Company retrospectively adopted the new Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants Handbook Section 3064, ""Goodwill and Intangible Assets"", with no restatement of prior periods. The adoption of these recommendations had no material impact on the interim consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which consist only of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position at December 31, 2009 and the results of operations and cash flows for the three-months and years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. 2. RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES For the years ended December 31 of 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded impairment charges as follows: 2009 2008

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------- (a) North America For the year ended December 31, 2009 In conjunction with its annual business planning cycle, during the fourth quarter of 2009 the Company determined that its Car Top Systems (""CTS"") North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired, primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic reduction in the market for soft tops, hard tops and modular retractable hard tops; and (ii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout the Company's business planning period. Based on the reporting unit's discounted forecast cashflows, the Company recorded a $25 million goodwill impairment charge. In addition, during the second quarter of 2009, after failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain facility in Syracuse, New York, the Company decided to wind down these operations. Given the significance of the facility's cashflows in relation to the reporting unit, management determined that it was more likely than not that goodwill at the Powertrain North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired. Therefore, the Company recorded a $75 million goodwill impairment charge. The goodwill impairment charges were calculated by determining the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if it had acquired the Powertrain and CTS reporting units as at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $13 million ($11 million after tax) related to fixed assets at a die casting facility in Canada and an anticipated under recovery of capitalized tooling costs at a stamping facility in the United States due to significantly lower volumes on certain SUV programs. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company recorded restructuring costs of $6 million in cost of goods sold ($6 million after tax) related to the planned closure of a powertrain facility in Syracuse, New York, substantially all of which will be paid subsequent to 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2008 During 2008, the Company recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $275 million ($238 million after tax), related primarily to its powertrain and interior and exterior systems operations in the United States and Canada. At the Company's powertrain operations, particularly at a facility in Syracuse, New York, asset impairment charges of $189 million ($169 million after tax) were recorded primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic market shift away from truck programs, in particular four wheel drive pick-up trucks and SUVs; (iii) excess die-casting, machining and assembly capacity; and (iii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout the Company's business planning period. At its interiors and exteriors operations, the Company recorded $74 million ($61 million after tax) of asset impairment charges primarily as a result of: (i) significantly lower volumes on certain pick-up truck and SUV programs; (ii) the loss of certain replacement business; and (iii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout the Company's business planning period. During 2008, the Company recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $79 million in cost of goods sold and $5 million in selling, general and administrative expense ($60 million after tax) related to the above long-lived asset impairments and other restructuring activities. Substantially all of the $84 million was paid during 2009. (b) Europe For the year ended December 31, 2009 During 2009, the Company recorded long-lived assets impairment charges of $70 million ($70 million after tax) related to its CTS and exterior systems operations in Germany. At the Company's CTS operations, long-lived asset impairment charges of $59 million ($59 million after tax) were recorded related to fixed and intangible assets. The impairment charge was calculated based on the CTS' discounted forecast cashflows and was necessary primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic reduction in the market for soft tops, hard tops and modular retractable hard tops; and (ii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout the Company's business planning period. At its exteriors operations, the Company recorded an $11 million ($11 million after tax) asset impairment charge related to specific under-utilized assets in Germany. During 2009, the Company recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $17 million in cost of goods sold and $3 million in selling, general and administrative expense ($20 million after tax). The charges consist primarily of severance and other termination benefits related to the closure of powertrain and interior systems facilities in Germany. Substantially all of the $20 million will be paid subsequent to 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2008 During 2008, the Company recorded an $8 million ($8 million after tax) asset impairment related to the disposal of specific assets at an interior systems facility in the United Kingdom and specific assets at a powertrain facility in Austria. 3.

The acquired business is primarily located in the Czech Republic with sales to various customers, including Skoda. On June 1, 2009, Magna acquired several facilities from Meridian Automotive Systems Inc. The facilities located in the United States and Mexico manufacture composites for various customers. The total consideration for these acquisitions and certain other acquisitions was $136 million, consisting of $50 million paid in cash and $86 million of assumed debt. The purchase price allocations for these acquisitions are preliminary and adjustments to the allocations may occur as a result of obtaining more information regarding asset valuations. On a preliminary basis, an allocation of the excess purchase price over the book value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been made to goodwill and intangible assets. 5. INVESTMENTS At December 31, 2009, the Company held Canadian third party asset- backed commercial paper (""ABCP"") with a face value of Cdn$134 million and a carrying value of Cdn$88 million (December 31, 2008 - Cdn$79 million), which was based on a valuation technique that estimates the fair value based on relevant current market indices for instruments of comparable credit quality, term and structure (""current market indices""). During the third quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a $9 million increase in the carrying value of it's investment in ABCP in selling, general and administrative expense, due to a tightening of the spread between the anticipated return on the restructured notes and the current market indices. During 2008, the Company recorded a $41 million impairment charge (Q3 - $24 million; Q1 - $17 million) in selling, general and administrative expense. The impairment charge was calculated based on the anticipated return on the restructured notes (the ""Notes"") versus the spreads using current market indices and a charge against potentially non-performing assets calculated on a probability weighted basis. Refer to note 8 of the Company's 2008 audited consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the significant estimates and assumptions incorporated into the valuation of our ABCP. 6.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the second quarter of 2009 the Company amended its Retiree Premium Reimbursement Plan in Canada and the United States, such that employees retiring on or after August 1, 2009 will no longer participate in the plan. The amendment will reduce service costs and retirement medical benefit expense in 2009. As a result of amending the plan, a curtailment gain of $26 million was recorded in cost of goods sold during the three-month period ended June 30, 2009. 9. INCOME TAXES During the third quarter of 2008, the Company recorded a $123 million charge to establish valuation allowances against all future tax assets in the United States. The valuation allowances were required in the United States based on historical consolidated losses at the Company's U.S. operations, that were expected to continue in the near-term, the accelerated deterioration of near-term automotive market conditions in the United States and the significant and inherent uncertainty as to the timing of when the Company would be able to generate the necessary level of earnings to recover these future tax assets. 10.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- (i) The exercise price noted above represents the weighted average exercise price in Canadian dollars. (ii) On August 12, 2009, following approval by the Company's Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee and in accordance with the Amended and Restated Incentive Stock Option Plan, the Company granted stock appreciation rights (""SARs"") to certain executives in respect of 191,700 previously granted and unexercised stock options. On August 14, 2009, 166,411 SARs were exercised and an equal number of previously granted and unexercised stock options were surrendered and cancelled. On exercise of the SARs, the executives received, in aggregate, cash of $1 million, representing an amount equal to the difference between the aggregate fair market value of the shares covered by the surrendered options and the aggregate exercise price of such surrendered options. Fair market value was determined based on the weighted average closing price of the Company's Class A Subordinate Voting Shares on the New York Stock Exchange for the five consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date of exercise. In addition, during the third quarter of 2009, 25,289 SARs were cancelled upon exercise of the corresponding number of options. The weighted average assumptions used in measuring the fair value of stock options granted or modified and the compensation expense recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses are as follows: Year ended

CAPITAL DISCLOSURES The Company manages capital in order to ensure the Company has adequate borrowing capacity and financial structure to allow financial flexibility and to provide an adequate return to shareholders. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares, purchase shares for cancellation, or increase or decrease the amount of debt outstanding. The Company monitors capital using the ratio of debt to total capitalization. Debt includes bank indebtedness and term debt as shown in the balance sheets. Total capitalization includes debt and all components of shareholders' equity. The Company's capitalization and debt to total capitalization is as follows: December December
 31, 2009 31, 2008

 Bank indebtedness $ 48 $ 909

 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 $ 4,414 $ 5,236
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 ----------------------------------------------------------------- (b) Fair value The Company determined the estimated fair values of its financial instruments based on valuation methodologies it believes are appropriate; however, considerable judgment is required to develop these estimates. Accordingly, these estimated fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The estimated fair value amounts can be materially affected by the use of different assumptions or methodologies. The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments are described below: Cash and cash equivalents, bank indebtedness, accounts payable, accrued salaries and wages, other accrued liabilities and income taxes receivable. Due to the short period to maturity of the instruments, the carrying values as presented in the consolidated balance sheets are reasonable estimates of fair values. Investments At December 31, 2009, the Company held Canadian third party asset-backed commercial paper (""ABCP"") with a face value of Cdn$134 million. The carrying value and estimated fair value of this investment was Cdn$88 million (December 31, 2008 - Cdn$79 million). As fair value information is not readily determinable for the Company's investment in ABCP, the fair value was based on a valuation technique estimating the fair value from the perspective of a market participant. In addition, fair value information is not readily available for the Company's investment in equity accounted investees. However, management believes the market value to be in excess of the carrying value of these investments. Term debt The Company's term debt includes $16 million due within one year. Due to the short period to maturity of this debt, the carrying value as presented in the consolidated balance sheet is a reasonable estimate of its fair value. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt, based on the current rates for debt with similar terms and maturities, is not materially different from its carrying value. (c) Credit risk The Company's financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, held to maturity investments, and foreign exchange forward contracts with positive fair values. The Company's held for trading investments include an investment in ABCP. Given the continuing uncertainties regarding the value of the underlying assets, the amount and timing over cash flows and the risk of collateral calls in the event that spreads widened considerably, the Company could be exposed to further losses on its investment. Cash and cash equivalents, which consists of short-term investments, are only invested in governments, bank term deposits and bank commercial paper with an investment grade credit rating. Credit risk is further reduced by limiting the amount which is invested in certain governments or any major financial institution. The Company is also exposed to credit risk from the potential default by any of its counterparties on its foreign exchange forward contracts. The Company mitigates this credit risk by dealing with counterparties who are major financial institutions that the Company anticipates will satisfy their obligations under the contracts. In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to credit risk from its customers, substantially all of which are in the automotive industry and are subject to credit risks associated with the automotive industry. Sales to the Company's three largest customers, General Motors, BMW and Ford for the three months and year ended December 31, 2009 represented 47% and 49% of the Company's total sales, respectively. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2009, sales to the Company's six largest customers (including the Detroit 3) represented 81% and 82% of the Company's total sales, respectively, and substantially all of our sales are to customers in which the Company has ongoing contractual relationships. (d) Currency risk The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates when manufacturing facilities have committed to the delivery of products for which the selling price has been quoted in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency, or when materials and equipment are purchased in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency. In an effort to manage this net foreign exchange exposure, the Company employs hedging programs, primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. As at December 31, 2009, the net foreign exchange exposure was not material. (e) Interest rate risk The Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk due to the short-term maturity of its monetary current assets and current liabilities. In particular, the amount of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents is impacted more by the investment decisions made and the demands to have available cash on hand, than by movements in the interest rates over a given period. In addition, the Company is not exposed to interest rate risk on its term debt instruments as the interest rates on these instruments are fixed.","Please click HERE for a PDF version of the release. - Magna annonce ses résultats pour le quatrième trimestre et pour l'exercice 2009 - Magna gibt Finanzergebnis für viertes Quartal und Gesamtjahr 2009 bekanntAURORA, ON, Feb 25, 2010 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Magna International Inc.

 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 ---------------------------- We posted sales of $17.4 billion for 2009, a decrease of 27% from 2008. This lower sales level was a result of decreases in We North American and European production sales, complete vehicle assembly sales and tooling, engineering and other sales, offset in part by an increase in Rest of World production sales. External production sales in North America decreased 31% or $3.4 billion to $7.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $10.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease in production sales reflects a 32% decrease in North American vehicle production volumes partially offset by a 1% increase in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. External production sales in Europe decreased 17% or $1.2 billion to $5.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $7.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008December 31, 2008. This decrease in production sales reflects a 19% decrease in European vehicle production volumes partially offset by a 2% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. Complete vehicle assembly sales decreased 47% to $1.8 billion for 2009 compared to $3.3 billion for 2008, while complete vehicle assembly volumes declined 55% to approximately 57 thousand units. During 2009, operating loss was $511 million, net loss was $493 million and diluted loss per share was $4.41, decreases of $839 million, $564 million and $5.03, respectively, each compared to 2008. During 2009 and 2008, we recorded a number of unusual items, including impairment charges associated with goodwill, long-lived assets and future tax assets, restructuring charges, foreign currency gains, net losses on disposal of a facility, future tax charges and a curtailment gain. The aggregate charge to net income for 2009 and 2008 related to unusual items totalled $195 and $313 million, respectively. On a per share basis, the aggregate net charge for unusual items totalled $1.74 and $2.75 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, we generated cash from operations of $621 million before changes in non-cash operating assets and liabilities, and invested $94 million in non-cash operating assets and liabilities. Total investment activities for 2009 were $906 million, including $629 million in fixed asset additions, a $227 million increase in investments and other assets and $50 million to purchase subsidiaries. THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 ------------------------------------ we posted sales of $5.4 billion for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, an increase of 12% from the fourth quarter of 2008. This higher sales level was a result of increases in we North American, European and Rest of World production sales and complete vehicle assembly sales, offset in part by decreases in we tooling, engineering and other sales. External production sales in North America increased 1% or $24 million to $2.42 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $2.39 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase in production sales reflects a 2% increase in North American vehicle production volumes partially offset by a 1% decrease in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. External production sales in Europe increased 35% or $450 million to $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase in production sales reflects a 13% increase in European vehicle production volumes combined with a 20% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 7% to $512 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $479 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, while complete vehicle assembly volumes declined 6% to approximately 16,000 units. During the fourth quarter of 2009, operating loss was $125 million, net loss was $139 million and diluted loss per share was $1.25, increases of $40 million, $9 million and $0.08, respectively, each compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. During the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, we recorded a number of unusual items, including restructuring charges, impairment charges associated with goodwill and long-lived assets and a loss on disposal of a facility. The aggregate charge to net income for the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008 related to unusual items totalled $134 million and $72 million, respectively. On a per share basis, the aggregate net charge for unusual items for the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008 totalled $1.20 and $0.65, respectively. During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, we generated cash from operations of $267 million before changes in non-cash operating assets and liabilities, and generated $247 million from non-cash operating assets and liabilities. Total investment activities for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $259 million, including $230 million in fixed asset additions and a $29 million increase in other assets. A more detailed discussion of our consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2009 is contained in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Position and the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which are attached to this Press Release. UPDATED 2010 OUTLOOK -------------------- For the full year 2010, we expect we consolidated sales to be between $19 billion and $20 billion, based on full year 2010 light vehicle production volumes of approximately 10.5 million units in North America and approximately 11.4 million units in Europe. Full year 2010 average dollar content per vehicle is expected to be between $895 and $925 in North America and between $510 and $535 in Europe. We expect We full year 2010 complete vehicle assembly sales to be between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion. In addition, We expect that full year 2010 spending for fixed assets will be in the range of $750 million to $800 million. This 2010 outlook assumes no significant acquisitions or divestitures. In addition, we have assumed that foreign exchange rates for the most common currencies in which we conduct business relative to our U.S. dollar reporting currency will approximate current rates. We are the most diversified global automotive supplier. We design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced automotive systems, assemblies, modules and components, and engineer and assemble complete vehicles, primarily for sale to original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"") of cars and light trucks.

We design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced automotive systems, assemblies, modules and components, and engineer and assemble complete vehicles, primarily for sale to original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"") of cars and light trucks. We capabilities include the design, engineering, testing and manufacture of automotive interior systems; seating systems; closure systems; body and chassis systems; vision systems; electronic systems; exterior systems; powertrain systems; roof systems; hybrid and electric vehicles/systems; as well as complete vehicle engineering and assembly. We follow a corporate policy of functional and operational decentralization, pursuant to which We conduct We operations through divisions, each of which is an autonomous business unit operating within pre-determined guidelines. As at December 31, 2009, We had 238 manufacturing divisions and 79 product development, engineering and sales centres in 25 countries. We operations are segmented on a geographic basis between North America, Europe and Rest of World (primarily Asia, South America and Africa). A Co- Chief Executive Officer heads management in each of our two primary markets, North America and Europe. The role of the North American and European management teams is to manage our interests to ensure a coordinated effort across our different capabilities. In addition to maintaining key customer, supplier and government contacts in supplier and government contacts respective markets, the North American and European management teams centrally manage key aspects of our operations while permitting our divisions enough flexibility through our decentralized structure to foster an entrepreneurial environment. HIGHLIGHTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- The automotive industry had a challenging year in 2009. The year began with weak global vehicle sales and production, most notably in the North American and Western European markets. In the first half of 2009, North American and Western European vehicle production declined 50% and 33%, respectively, as compared to the first half of 2008. The worsening economic and industry conditions which became apparent in the second half of 2008 accelerated the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of OEMs and suppliers, culminating in the bankruptcy filings of Chrysler and General Motors in April and June, respectively. During their respective periods under bankruptcy protection, vehicle production for Chrysler and General Motors was negligible. More generally, annualized vehicle sales in North America for the first half of 2009 remained at levels not experienced for more than 25 years. European vehicle sales and production, while down significantly from the previous year, were buoyed by a number of ""scrappage"" programs implemented by various European governments, which generally provided financial incentives for consumers to replace older, less fuel-efficient and typically higher polluting vehicles, with new vehicles, thereby stimulating vehicle sales. We began to see signs of improvement in the second half of 2009, particularly in North America. New vehicle selling rates strengthened, as consumer confidence levels increased and economic stimuli began to work New vehicle selling rates way through various economies. In North America, vehicle inventory days declined to levels which were below long term trend levels, due in part to production shut-downs and the positive effect of a vehicle scrappage program implemented in North America. Nevertheless, by historical standards, full year vehicle sales and production in North America and Western Europe remained at low levels. North American vehicle production ended 2009 down 32%, as compared to 2008, marking the seventh straight year of declining production. Western European production declined 19% compared to 2008, despite the impact of the various scrappage programs. In 2009, We continued with restructuring and downsizing actions in order to mitigate the impact of continued production volume declines. We also undertook a number of other cost-saving measures, including reduced discretionary spending across the organization, employee reductions, short work week schedules, reduced bonuses, voluntary wage reductions and benefit plan changes. Despite these actions, the weak production environment adversely impacted our 2009 operating results. Total sales declined 27% in 2009, compared to 2008, primarily as a result of the declines in vehicle production in North America and Western EuropeWestern Europe, along with a 47% decline in complete vehicle assembly sales and a 16% decline in tooling, engineering and other sales. Operating income for 2009 decreased $839 million, to a loss of $511 million, from income of $328 million in 2008. On the positive side, the severe industry conditions provided opportunities for us to strengthen our business relative to some of our competitors. our were successful in securing significant takeover business in 2009. our also completed selective acquisitions, including Cadence Innovation s.r.o, located primarily in the Czech Republic (""Cadence""), and several facilities in Mexico and U.S. U.S. from Meridian Automotive Systems Inc. (""Meridian""). An additional bright spot was the continued growth of our business and manufacturing footprint outside our traditional markets of North America and Western Europe, which contributed to a 31% increase in Rest of World production sales, our eighth straight year of increasing production sales in this segment. During a period when several of our automotive supplier competitors ceased operations, were consolidated or experienced significant financial difficulties, our strong balance sheet and overall financial flexibility leading into the economic downturn, coupled with our financial discipline, cash flow generation and significant cash preservation and cost cutting efforts allowed us to preserve shareholder value and position us well to enhance such value in the future. us strong financial position allows us to continue to invest in innovation. Notably, in the past few years, us have been investing to expand us capabilities and footprint in electronics. We see electronics as an area of future growth for The automotive industry and for Magna. More recently, we have been investing to develop we component, system and integration capabilities in the growing hybrid/electric vehicle market. However, we will need to further invest in both electronics and hybrid/electric vehicle systems before we generate appropriate returns from these investments. we investments in these areas negatively impacted we earnings in 2009, and we planned investments in 2010 are expected to be higher. After a very turbulent year in many automotive markets, we expect global vehicle production to grow a very turbulent year in many automotive markets, led by growth in North America, provided that overall economic conditions continue to improve. Forecast growth in North American vehicle production would reverse the seven year slide experienced in this critical vehicle market. We are less optimistic about the near-term growth potential of the Western European market, which we believe will lag in 2010 due to the impact in 2009 of scrappage incentives which mitigated what would likely have been much weaker vehicle demand last year by ""pulling forward"" sales. FINANCIAL RESULTS SUMMARY ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During 2009, we posted sales of $17.4 billion, a decrease of 27% from 2008. This lower sales level was a result of decreases in we North American and European production sales, complete vehicle assembly sales and tooling, engineering and other sales offset in part by an increase in our Rest of World production sales. Comparing 2009 to 2008: - North American average dollar content per vehicle increased 1%, while
 vehicle production declined 32%;
 - European average dollar content per vehicle increased 2%, while
 vehicle production declined 19%; and
 - Complete vehicle assembly sales decreased 47% to $1.8 billion from
 $3.3 billion, as complete vehicle assembly volumes declined 55%.
 During 2009, we generated an operating loss of $511 million compared to operating income of $328 million for 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2009 and 2008, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, operating income declined $899 million. Included in operating income for 2009 and 2008 are several ""Significant Items"" that impact operating income representing approximately $220 million and $85 million, respectively. ""Significant Items"" consist primarily of: - downsizing and other restructuring activities that have not been
 included in the ""Unusual Items"" section;
 - accounts receivable valuation allowances recorded in 2009;
 - in 2009, a $9 million favourable adjustment (2008 - $41 million
 impairment) of our investment in ABCP as discussed in the ""Cash
 Resources"" section;
 - a favourable settlement on research and development incentives during
 2008;
 - due diligence costs associated with our planned investment in Opel,
 which terminated during 2009;
 - accelerated amortization of deferred wage buydown assets at a
 powertrain systems facility in North America during 2008;
 - the write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related
 to the cancelation of an assembly program in the fourth quarter of
 2009;
 - costs related to the delay in the start of production of a program;
 and
 - other losses on disposal of assets.
 In addition, operating income was negatively impacted by: - decreased margin earned on reduced sales as a result of significantly
 lower vehicle production volumes;
 - costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches or for programs
 that have not fully ramped up production primarily in Europe;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities;
 - costs incurred at new facilities in Russia as we continue to pursue
 opportunities in this market;
 - electric vehicle development costs;
 - costs incurred to develop and grow we electronics capabilities;
 - higher commodity costs; and
 - net customer price concessions.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 savings initiatives (including reduced discretionary spending,
 employee reductions, short work week schedules, reduced bonuses,
 voluntary wage reductions and benefit plan changes), undertaken
 during or subsequent to 2008;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities; and
 - incremental margin earned from acquisitions completed during or
 subsequent to 2008.
 During 2009, net loss was $493 million compared to net income of $71 million for 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2009 and 2008, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income for 2009 decreased $682 million. The decrease in net income was a result of the decrease in operating income partially offset by lower income taxes. During 2009, our diluted loss per share was $4.41 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.62 for 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2009 and 2008, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, diluted earnings per share for 2009 decreased $6.04. The decrease in diluted earnings per share is as a result of the decrease in net income, excluding unusual items, and a decrease in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during 2009. The decrease in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to the effect of the repurchase and cancelation of Class A Subordinate Voting Shares in 2008 under the terms of our Normal Course Issuer Bid and a decrease in the number of diluted shares associated with restricted stock and stock options since such shares were anti-dilutive in 2009.

 (a) For the year ended December 31, 2009 (i) Goodwill In conjunction with the Company's annual business planning cycle, during the fourth quarter of 2009 we determined that we Car Top Systems (""CTS"") North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired, primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic reduction in the market for soft tops, hard tops and modular retractable hard tops; and (ii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout our business planning period. Based on North America reporting unit's discounted forecast cashflows, our recorded a $25 million goodwill impairment charge. In addition, during the second quarter of 2009, after failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York, we decided to wind down failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York. Given the significance of the facility's cashflows in relation to North America reporting unit, management determined that it was more likely than not that goodwill at North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired. Therefore, we recorded a $75 million goodwill impairment charge. The goodwill impairment charges were calculated by determining the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if we had acquired the Powertrain and CTS reporting units as at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009, respectively. (ii) Long-lived Assets Also in conjunction with our annual business planning cycle, during the fourth quarter of 2009 our recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $83 million. In North America, our recorded charges of $13 million related to fixed assets at a die casting facility in Canada and an anticipated under recovery of capitalized tooling costs at a stamping facility in North America due to significantly lower volumes on certain SUV programs. In Europe, our recorded long-lived assets impairment charges of $70 million related to our CTS and exterior systems operations in Germany. At our CTS operations, long-lived asset impairment charges of $59 million were recorded related to fixed and intangible assets. The impairment charge was calculated based on CTS discounted forecast cashflows and was necessary primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic reduction in the market for soft tops, hard tops and modular retractable hard tops; and (ii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout our business planning period. At our interiors and exteriors operations, our recorded an $11 million asset impairment charge related to specific under-utilized assets in Germany. (iii) Restructuring Costs During 2009, our recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $23 million in cost of goods sold and $3 million in selling, general and administrative expense. During the second quarter, our recorded restructuring costs of $6 million related to the planned closure of a powertrain systems facility in Syracuse, New York New York and during the fourth quarter our recorded severance and other termination benefits related to the closure of powertrain and interior systems facilities in Germany. Substantially all of the $26 million will be paid subsequent to 2009. In addition, during 2009 and 2008, our incurred costs related to downsizing various operations in our traditional markets. (b) For the year ended December 31, 2008 (i) Long-lived Assets As a result of the significant and accelerated declines in vehicle production volumes, primarily in North America, our reviewed goodwill and long- lived assets for impairment during the third quarter of 2008. Based on this analysis, during 2008 our recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $283 million related primarily to our powertrain, and interior and exterior systems operations in North America and Canada. At our , particularly at a facility in Syracuse, New York, asset impairment charges of $189 million were recorded primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic market shift away from truck programs, in particular four wheel drive pick-up trucks and SUVs; (ii) excess die-casting, machining and assembly capacity; and (iii) historical losses that were projected to continue throughout our . At our interiors and exteriors operations, our recorded $74 million of asset impairment charges primarily as a result of: (i) significantly lower volumes on certain pick-up truck and SUV programs; (ii) the loss of certain replacement business; (iii) capacity utilization that is not sufficient to support the current overhead structure; and (iv) historical losses that were projected to continue throughout our . Additionally, in North America our recorded asset impairment charges of $12 million related to dedicated assets at a chassis systems facility in Canada and a seating systems facility in North America. In Europe, our recorded an $8 million asset impairment related to specific assets at an interior systems facility in North America and specific assets at a powertrain systems facility in Austria. (ii) Restructuring Charges During 2008, our recorded restructuring and rationalization costs in North America of $79 million in cost of goods sold and $5 million in selling, general and administrative expense. restructuring and rationalization costs in North America of $79 million in cost of goods sold and $5 million in selling, general and administrative expense were primarily recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008 and relate to: (i) the consolidation of interiors and exteriors operations in Canada and North America; (ii) the closure of a seating systems facility in St. Louis, Missouri; (iii) the consolidation of closure systems operations in Canada; and (iv) the consolidation of our powertrain die casting operations in Canada and the United States. During 2008, our also incurred costs related to downsizing various operations. (2) Sale of Facility During 2009, our entered into an agreement to sell an engineering centre in Europe and, as a result, incurred a loss on disposition of the facility of $8 million. (3) Foreign Currency Gains In the normal course of business, we review we cash investment and tax planning strategies, including where such funds are invested. As a result of these reviews, during the third quarter of 2008 our repatriated funds from Europe and as a result recorded foreign currency gains of $116 million. (4) Income Taxes During the third quarter of 2008, our recorded a $123 million charge to establish valuation allowances against all of our future tax assets in North America. valuation allowances against all of our future tax assets in the United States were required in North America based on historical consolidated losses at our U.S. operations, that were expected to continue in the near-term, the accelerated deterioration of near-term automotive market conditions in North America and the significant and inherent uncertainty as to the timing of when we would be able to generate the necessary level of earnings to recover these future tax assets. (5) Curtailment gain During the second quarter of 2009, we amended we Retiree Premium Reimbursement Plan in Canada and North America, such that most employees retiring on or after August 1, 2009 will no longer participate in the plan. The amendment will reduce service costs and retirement medical benefit expense in 2009 and future years. As a result of amending the plan, a curtailment gain of $26 million was recorded in cost of goods sold in the second quarter of 2009. INDUSTRY TRENDS AND RISKS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- With the apparent stabilization and improvement in the global automotive industry in the second half of 2009, a number of the trends which impacted the industry and our business beginning in the second half of 2008 appear to be diminishing. For example, vehicle production levels, particularly in North America, appear to be improving as compared to the low levels experienced in the second half of 2008 and first half of 2009. However, forecast vehicle production levels in both North America and Europe for 2010 remain significantly below historic averages and remain sensitive to continued improvement in overall economic conditions. Similarly, while the short-term viability of several of our customers has improved due to significant government intervention and restructuring actions, the long-term viability of certain of our customers remains uncertain. Continued improvement in the global automotive industry is heavily dependent on factors such as consumer confidence, employment levels, household debt, real estate values, the continued availability of consumer credit, interest rates, energy prices and other factors. At this time, it is too early to determine whether the apparent stabilization and improvement in the economy and automotive industry in the second half of 2009 will continue. The impact of other recent trends also remains uncertain. For example, as a result of the restructuring of the global automotive industry in 2008/2009, the financial condition of the automotive supply base deteriorated significantly, with a number of suppliers restructuring while under bankruptcy protection or ceasing operations altogether. In the short-term, we have secured a significant amount of takeover business as we customers transferred business from weak suppliers to stronger suppliers. However, the mid to long- term impact of the restructuring of the automotive supply base cannot be determined at this time. Some of our competitors have successfully emerged from bankruptcy restructurings, leaving Some of our competitors with strong balance sheets, reduced cost structures and improved overall competitiveness. One recent and growing trend in the global automotive industry, born out of the need to carefully manage costs, is the growth of cooperative alliances and arrangements among competing automotive OEMs. New and increasing relationships include features such as: shared purchasing of components; joint engine, powertrain and/or platform development; and engine, powertrain and platform sharing. Cooperation among competing OEMs is expected to increase, particularly with respect to vehicle hybridization and electrification, in order to lower the entry cost for OEMs to compete in these vehicle segments. A number of general trends which have been impacting the global automotive industry in recent years are expected to continue, including: - the exertion of pricing pressure by OEMs;
 - government incentives and consumer demand for, and industry focus on,
 more fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly vehicles with
 alternative-energy fuel systems and additional safety features;
 - governmental regulation of fuel economy and emissions;
 - the long-term growth of the automotive industry in China, India,
 Brazil, Russia and other developing markets, including accelerated
 migration of component and vehicle design, development, engineering
 and manufacturing to certain of these markets;
 - the growth of the A to D vehicle segments (micro to mid-size cars),
 particularly in developing markets; and
 - the consolidation of vehicle platforms.
 The following are some of the more significant risks that could affect our ability to achieve our desired results: - the global automotive industry is cyclical and is sensitive to
 changes in economic and political conditions, including interest
 rates, energy prices and international conflicts. Commencing in the
 second half of 2008, the global automotive industry experienced a more
 severe cyclical downturn than in prior cycles due to the disruption
 of global credit markets beginning in September 2008, the
 corresponding reduction in access to credit (particularly for
 purposes of vehicle financing), the deterioration of housing and
 equity markets and the resulting erosion in personal net worth, all
 of which led to extremely low consumer confidence, particularly in
 the U.S and which in turn, severely impacted automotive sales. While
 the global economy is currently showing signs of improvement,
 uncertainty remains. As a result of restructuring actions taken by
 OEMs and suppliers during the most recent cyclical downturn,
 automotive production levels are more closely aligned with actual
 automotive sales levels and, accordingly, are sensitive to overall
 economic conditions. The continuation of current or lower production
 volumes and sales levels for an extended period of time could have a
 material adverse effect on our profitability.
 - While the global economy is currently experiencing a gradual recovery
 and the condition of the global automotive industry appears to have
 stabilized and improved beginning in the latter half of 2009,
 considerable uncertainty remains as to the breadth and depth of a
 global economic and industry recovery, including the timing of a
 return to more normal market conditions. As a result of this
 continued uncertainty, we remain subject to considerable planning
 risk with respect to our business. A slower than anticipated recovery
 or a deterioration of economic conditions could have a material
 adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.
 - The short-term viability of several of our OEM customers appears to
 have improved as a result of restructuring actions in the past few
 years, as well as extraordinary levels of government financial
 intervention in the global automotive industry, particularly in 2009.
 However, there can be no assurance that these restructuring actions
 will be successful in ensuring these restructuring actions
  long- term viability, nor can
 there be any assurance that government financial assistance will be
 made available at levels necessary to prevent OEM failures in the
 future. The bankruptcy of any of our major customers could have a
 material adverse effect on our .
 Additionally, since OEMs rely on a highly interdependent network of
 suppliers, an OEM bankruptcy could materially disrupt the supply
 chain, which could have a material adverse effect on our
 profitability and financial condition.
 - our rely on a number of suppliers to supply us with a wide range of
 components required in connection with us business. While the automotive supply base appears to be stabilizing following the severe
 cyclical downturn which commenced in the second half of 2008, the
 financial health of automotive suppliers is impacted by economic
 conditions, production volume cuts, intense pricing pressures and
 other factors. The insolvency or bankruptcy of a supplier could
 disrupt the supply of components to us or us customers, potentially
 causing the temporary shut-down of us or our customers' production
 lines. Any prolonged disruption in the supply of critical components
 to us or us customers, the inability to re source or insource
 production of a critical component from a financially distressed
 automotive components sub-supplier, or any temporary shut-down of one
 of us production lines or the production lines of one of our
 customers, could have a material adverse effect on us profitability.
 Additionally, the insolvency, bankruptcy or financial restructuring
 of any of us critical suppliers could result in us incurring
 unrecoverable costs related to the financial work-out of such
 suppliers and/or increased exposure for product liability, warranty
 or recall costs relating to the components supplied by such suppliers
 to the extent such supplier is not able to assume responsibility for
 such amounts, which could have an adverse effect on our
 profitability.
 - The automotive parts supply industry is highly competitive. As a
 result of our diversified automotive business, we face a number of
 competitors possessing varying degrees of financial and operational
 strength in each our of product and service capabilities. Some of our
 competitors have a substantially greater market share than us and are
 dominant in some of the markets in which we do business. In addition,
 recent restructuring actions taken by some of our competitors have
 provided some of our competitors with improved financial and operational flexibility and
 could increase some of our competitors competitive threat to our business, including
 increasing some of our competitors market share at our expense. We may not be able to
 compete successfully with We existing competitors or with any new
 competitors, which could have an adverse effect on We operations and
 profitability.
 - We are dependent on the outsourcing of components, modules and
 assemblies, as well as complete vehicles, by OEMs. The extent of OEM
 outsourcing is influenced by a number of factors, including relative
 cost, quality and timeliness of production by suppliers as compared
 to OEMs, capacity utilization, labour relations among OEMs, OEMs
 employees and unions and other considerations. As a result of lower
 cost structures due to recent restructuring actions, the OEMs' may
 insource production which had previously been outsourced. Outsourcing
 of complete vehicle assembly is particularly dependent on the degree
 of unutilized capacity at the OEMs' own assembly facilities, in
 addition to the foregoing factors. A reduction in outsourcing by
 OEMs, or the loss of any material production or assembly programs
 coupled with the failure to secure alternative programs with
 sufficient volumes and margins, could have a material adverse effect
 on our profitability.
 - We continue to invest in technology and innovation, including certain
 alternative-energy technologies which we believe will be critical to
 our long-term growth. our ability to anticipate changes in technology
 and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products
 on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to
 remain competitive. If there is a shift away from the use of
 technologies in which we are investing, we costs may not be fully
 recovered. In addition, if other technologies in which our investment
 is not as great or our expertise is not as developed emerge as the
 industry-leading technologies, we may be placed at a competitive
 disadvantage, which could have a material adverse effect on our
 profitability and financial condition.
 - As part of our strategy of continuously seeking to optimize our
 global manufacturing footprint, we may further rationalize some of
 we production facilities. In the course of such rationalization, we
 may incur further restructuring and/or downsizing costs related to
 plant closings, relocations and employee severance costs. Such costs
 could have an adverse effect on our short-term profitability. In
 addition, our are working to turn around financially underperforming
 divisions; however, there is no guarantee that our will be successful
 in doing so with respect to some or all such divisions.
 - our recorded significant impairment charges related to goodwill, long-
 lived assets and future tax assets in recent years and may continue
 to do so in the future. The bankruptcy of a significant customer or
 the early termination, loss, renegotiation of the terms of, or delay
 in the implementation of any significant production contract could be
 indicators of impairment. In addition, to the extent that forward-
 looking assumptions regarding the impact of improvement plans on
 current operations, insourcing and other new business opportunities,
 program price and cost assumptions on current and future business,
 the timing of new program launches and forecast production volumes
 are not met, any resulting impairment loss could have a material
 adverse effect on our profitability.
 - Although our supply parts to all of the leading OEMs, a significant
 majority of our sales are to six such customers. While our have
 diversified our customer base somewhat in recent years and continue
 to attempt to further diversify, particularly to increase our
 business with Asian-based OEMs, there is no assurance our
  will be
 successful. our inability to successfully grow our sales to non-
 traditional customers could have a material adverse effect on our
 profitability.
 - While our supply parts for a wide variety of vehicles produced in
 North America and Europe, our do not supply parts for all vehicles
 produced, nor is the number or value of parts evenly distributed
 among the vehicles for which we do supply parts. Shifts in market
 share among vehicles (including shifts away from vehicles we assemble
 or shifts away from specific parts we produce) or the early
 termination, loss, renegotiation of the terms of, or delay in the
 implementation of any significant production or assembly contract
 could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
 - Many of our customers have sought, and will likely continue to seek
 to take advantage of lower operating costs in China, India, Brazil,
 Russia and other developing markets. While our continue to expand our
 manufacturing footprint with a view to taking advantage of
 manufacturing opportunities in these markets, we cannot guarantee
 that we will be able to fully realize such opportunities.
 Additionally, the establishment of manufacturing operations in
 developing market countries carries the establishment of manufacturing operations in
 developing market countries own risks, including those
 relating to political and economic instability; trade, customs and
 tax risks; currency exchange rates; currency controls; insufficient
 infrastructure; and other risks associated with conducting business
 internationally. The inability to quickly adjust our manufacturing
 footprint to take advantage of manufacturing opportunities in these
 markets could harm our ability to compete with other suppliers
 operating in or from such markets, which could have an adverse effect
 on our profitability.
 - Recently, several major financial institutions failed or required
 massive government intervention in order to prevent collapse. The
 turmoil in the financial sector significantly affected the global
 economy, and contributed to a global recession. While financial
 markets appear to have stabilized, the failure of any major financial
 institutions in the future could lead to significant disruptions in
 capital and credit markets and could adversely affect our and our
 customers' ability to access needed liquidity for working capital. In
 addition, in the event of a failure of a financial institution; in
 which we invest we cash reserves; that is a counterparty in a
 derivative transaction with us; or a lender to we, we face the risk
 that that we cash reserves and amounts owing to we pursuant to
 derivative transactions may not be fully recoverable, or the amount
 of credit available to we may be significantly reduced. All of these
 risks could have an impact on we financial condition.
 - Although we financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a
 significant portion of we sales and operating costs are realized in
 Canadian dollars, euros, British pounds and other currencies. we
 profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against the
 Canadian dollar, the euro, the British pound and other currencies in
 which we generate revenues and incur expenses. However, as a result
 of hedging programs employed by us, foreign currency transactions are
 not fully impacted by movements in exchange rates. we record foreign
 currency transactions at the hedged rate where applicable. Despite
 these measures, significant long-term fluctuations in relative
 currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative
 values of the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, euro or British pound,
 could have an adverse effect on we profitability and financial
 condition and any sustained change in such related currency values
 could adversely impact our competitiveness in certain geographic
 regions.
 - our have completed a number of significant acquisitions in recent
 years and may continue to do so in the future. In those product areas
 in which we have identified acquisitions as critical to our business
 strategy, our may not be able to identify suitable acquisition targets
 or successfully acquire any suitable targets which we identify.
 Additionally, we may not be able to successfully integrate or achieve
 anticipated synergies from those acquisitions which we do complete
 and such failure could have a material adverse effect on we
 profitability.
 - We face significant pricing pressure, as well as pressure to absorb
 costs related to product design, engineering and tooling, as well as
 other items previously paid for directly by OEMs. These pressures are
 expected to continue, even as the industry begins to recover from the
 global recession. The continuation or intensification of these
 pricing pressures and pressure to absorb costs could have an adverse
 effect on our profitability.
 - our customers continue to demand that we bear the cost of the repair
 and replacement of defective products which are either covered under
 their warranty or are the subject of a recall by their. Warranty
 provisions are established based on our best estimate of the amounts
 necessary to settle existing or probable claims on product defect
 issues. Recall costs are costs incurred when government regulators
 and/or our customers decide to recall a product due to a known or
 suspected performance issue and we are required to participate either
 voluntarily or involuntarily. Currently, under most customer
 agreements, we only account for existing or probable warranty claims.
 Under certain complete vehicle engineering and assembly contracts, we
 record an estimate of future warranty-related costs based on the
 terms of the specific customer agreements and the specific customer's
 warranty experience. The obligation to repair or replace such
 products could have a material adverse effect on our profitability
 and financial condition if the actual costs are materially different
 from our estimates.
 - From time to time, we may become liable for legal, contractual and
 other claims by various parties, including customers, suppliers,
 former employees, class action plaintiffs and others. On an on going
 basis, our attempt to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments
 or outcomes to these claims, although it is difficult to predict
 final outcomes with any degree of certainty. At this time, we do not
 believe that any of the claims to which we are party will have a
 material adverse effect on we financial position; however, we cannot
 provide any assurance to a
 material adverse effect on our financial position. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Average Foreign Exchange

 The preceding table reflects the average foreign exchange rates between the most common currencies in which we conduct business and our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The significant changes in these foreign exchange rates for the three months and year ended December 31, 2009 impacted the reported U.S. dollar amounts of our sales, expenses and income. The results of operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates in the table above for the relevant period. Throughout this MD&A, reference is made to the impact of translation of foreign operations on reported U.S. dollar amounts where relevant. The results of operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar can also be affected by the impact of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency transactions (such as raw material purchases or sales denominated in foreign currencies). However, as a result of hedging programs employed by us, foreign currency transactions in the current period have not been fully impacted by movements in exchange rates. our record foreign currency transactions at the hedged rate where applicable. Finally, holding gains and losses on foreign currency denominated monetary items, which are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, impact reported results.

 External Production Sales - North America External production sales in North America decreased 31% or $3.4 billion to $7.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $10.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease in production sales reflects a 32% decrease in North American vehicle production volumes partially offset by a 1% increase in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. More importantly, during 2009 our largest customers in North America continued to reduce vehicle production volumes compared to 2008. While North American vehicle production volumes declined 32% in 2009 compared to 2008, Chrysler and GM vehicle production declined 48% and 44%, respectively. On a positive note, Ford's vehicle production decline was only 16%. Our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 1% or $5 to $872 for the year ended December 31, 2009 December 31, 2009 compared to $867 for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to 2008, including
 the:
 - Ford F-Series and Lincoln Mark LT;
 - Chevrolet Traverse;
 - Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain; and
 - Chevrolet Camaro;
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or increased
 content on certain programs, including the:
 - Ford Escape, Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute; and
 - Ford Fusion, Mercury Milan and Lincoln MKZ;
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to 2008, including
 - a substantial portion of Plastech Engineered Products Inc.'s
 exteriors business (""Plastech"");
 - Meridian; and
 - a stamping and sub-assembly facility in Alabama from Ogihara
 America Corporation; and
 - takeover business that launched during or subsequent to 2008.
 These factors were partially offset by: - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or lower
 content on certain programs, including the:
 - Chevrolet Cobalt;
 - Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and Volkswagen
 Routan;
 - Chrysler 300 and 300C and Dodge Charger; and
 - Buick Enclave and GMC Acadia;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to 2008,
 including the:
 - Saturn Vue, Aura and Outlook;
 - Chevrolet Trailblazer and GMC Envoy; and
 - Pontiac G5, G6, Solstice, Sky and GT;
 - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the
 Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar; and
 - customer price concessions during or subsequent to 2008.
 External Production Sales - Europe External production sales in Europe decreased 17% or $1.2 billion to $5.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 December 31, 2009 compared to $7.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008December 31, 2008. This decrease in production sales reflects a 19% decrease in European vehicle production volumes partially offset by a 2% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. our average dollar content per vehicle increased by 2% or $9 to $495 for the year ended December 31, 2009 December 31, 2009 compared to $486 for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to 2008, including
 the:
 - Audi Q5;
 - Volkswagen Golf;
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Opel/Vauxhall Insignia;
 - BMW One/Cooper Convertible; and
 - Volkswagen A5 Cabrio and Sportback; and
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to 2008, including
 Cadence.
 These factors were partially offset by: - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or lower
 content on certain programs, including the:
 - Chevrolet Cobalt;
 - Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and Volkswagen
 Routan;
 - Chrysler 300 and 300C and Dodge Charger; and

 - the sale of certain facilities during or subsequent to 2008; and
 - customer price concessions during or subsequent to 2008.
 External Production Sales - Rest of World External production sales in Rest of World increased 31% or $161 million to $676 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 December 31, 2009 compared to $515 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of: - increased production and/or content on certain programs in China and
 Brazil;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to 2008 in China and
 Japan; and
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales as a result of the
 strengthening of the Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. dollar.
 These factors were partially offset by: - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or lower
 content on certain programs, including the:
 - Chevrolet Cobalt;
 - Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and Volkswagen
 Routan;
 - Chrysler 300 and 300C and Dodge Charger; and

 - Pontiac G5, G6, Solstice, Sky and GT;
 - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the
 Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar; and
 - customer price concessions during or subsequent to 2008; and
 - decreased production and/or content on certain programs, particularly
 in South Africa.
 Complete Vehicle Assembly Sales The terms of our various vehicle assembly contracts differ with respect to the ownership of components and supplies related to the assembly process and the method of determining the selling price to the OEM customer. Under certain contracts our are acting as principal and purchased components and systems in assembled vehicles are included in our inventory and cost of sales. These costs are reflected on a full cost basis in the selling price of the final assembled vehicle to the OEM customer. Other contracts provide that third-party components and systems are held on consignment by us, and the selling price to the OEM customer reflects a value added assembly fee only. Production levels of the various vehicles assembled by us have an impact on the level of us sales and profitability. In addition, the relative proportion of programs accounted for on a full cost basis and programs accounted for on a value added basis also impacts our level of sales and operating margin percentage, but may not necessarily affect our overall level of profitability. Assuming no change in total vehicles assembled, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a full cost basis has the effect of increasing the level of total sales, however, because purchased components are included in cost of sales, profitability as a percentage of total sales is reduced. Conversely, a relative increase in the assembly of vehicles accounted for on a value added basis has the effect of reducing the level of total sales and increasing profitability as a percentage of total sales.

 Complete vehicle assembly sales decreased 47% or $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 December 31, 2009 compared to $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 December 31, 2008 while assembly volumes decreased 55% or 68,816 units. The decrease in complete vehicle assembly volumes is due to a combination of general economic conditions as discussed previously; the natural decline in volumes as certain models that we currently assemble approach their scheduled end of production; and a decrease in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. However, the Peugeot RCZ launched in the fourth quarter of 2009 and several new complete vehicle assembly programs have been awarded and are scheduled to launch throughout 2010 to 2013. Tooling, Engineering and Other Tooling, engineering and other sales decreased 16% or $0.3 billion to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 December 31, 2009 compared to $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008December 31, 2008. In the year ended December 31, 2009December 31, 2009, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - MINI Cooper, Clubman and Crossman;
 - Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra;
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Opel/Vauxhall Astra;
 - Audi Q5;
 - BMW X3;
 - Porsche Boxster and Cayman;
 - Porsche Cayenne;

 In the year ended December 31, 2008December 31, 2008, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - MINI Cooper, Clubman and Crossman;
 - BMW Z4, X3 and 1-Series;
 - GM's full-size pickups;
 - Cadillac SRX and Saab 9-4X;
 - Mazda 6;
 - Porsche 911 / Boxster;
 - Mercedes-Benz M-Class;
 - Chevrolet Equinox, Pontiac Torrent and Suzuki XL7;
 - Ford F-Series;
 - Lincoln MKS; and
 - Audi A5.
 In addition, tooling, engineering and other sales decreased as a result of the weakening of the euro and Canadian dollar, each against the U.S. dollar. Gross Margin Gross margin decreased $1.0 billion to $1.7 billion for 2009 compared to $2.7 billion for 2008 while gross margin as a percentage of total sales decreased to 9.6% for 2009 compared to 11.5% for 2008. The unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section negatively impacted gross margin as a percentage of total sales in 2008 by 0.3%. Excluding unusual items, gross margin as a percentage of total sales decreased by 2.2%. ""Significant Items"" also negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $125 million and $70 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, gross margin as a percentage of total sales was negatively impacted by: - lower gross margin earned due to the significant decline in vehicle
 production volumes;
 - costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches primarily in
 Europe;
 - electric vehicle development costs;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities;
 - a favourable revaluation of warranty accruals during 2008;
 - costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics capabilities;
 - additional supplier insolvency costs;
 - increased commodity costs; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2008.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives (including employee reductions, short work week
 schedules and benefit plan changes) undertaken during or subsequent
 to 2008;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - a decrease in complete vehicle assembly sales which have a lower
 gross margin than our consolidated average;
 - no employee profit sharing for 2009; and
 - the decrease in tooling and other sales that earn low or no margins.
 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization costs decreased 16% or $136 million to $737 million for 2009 compared to $873 million for 2008. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily as a result of: - the impairment of certain assets during 2008, in particular at a
 powertrain systems facility in the United States and certain
 interiors and exteriors systems facilities in North America;
 - the sale or disposition of certain facilities during or subsequent to
 2008; and
 - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar depreciation and amortization due
 to the weakening of the Canadian dollar and euro, each against the U.S. dollar.
 These factors were partially offset by acquisitions and capital spending during or subsequent to 2008. Selling, General and Administrative (""SG&A"") SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 7.3% for 2009, compared to 5.6% for 2008. The unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section negatively impacted SG&A as a percentage of total sales in 2009 by 0.1% and positively impacted SG&A as a percentage of total sales in 2008 by 0.4%. Excluding The unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section negatively impacted SG&A as a percentage of total sales in 2009 by 0.1% and positively impacted SG&A as a percentage of total sales in 2008 by 0.4%, SG&A as a percentage of total sales increased 1.2%. SG&A expense decreased 4% or $58 million to $1.26 billion for 2009 compared to $1.32 billion for 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in 2009 and 2008 (as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section), SG&A expenses decreased by $180 million. ""Significant Items"" also negatively impacted SG&A by approximately $95 million and $15 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, SG&A was positively impacted by: - cost saving initiatives, including reduced discretionary spending,
 employee reductions, reduced bonuses, voluntary wage reductions and
 benefit plan changes;
 - reduced spending at certain facilities as a result of restructuring
 and downsizing activities that were initiated during or subsequent
 to 2008;
 - a decrease in reported U.S. dollar SG&A expense due to the weakening
 of the Canadian dollar and euroeuro, each against the U.S. dollar; and
 - the sale or disposition of certain facilities during or subsequent to
 2008.
 These factors were partially offset by acquisitions completed during or subsequent to 2008, including Cadence. Impairment Charges Impairment charges decreased $100 million to $183 million for 2009 compared to $283 million for 2008 as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) EBIT is defined as income (loss) from operations before income taxes as presented on our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements before net interest expense (income). North America EBIT in North America decreased $7 million to a loss of $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 December 31, 2009 compared to a loss of $106 million for the year ended December 31, 2008December 31, 2008. Excluding the North American unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $273 million decrease in EBIT was substantially due to decreased margins earned on reduced sales as a result of significantly lower vehicle production volumes. ""Significant Items"" including, downsizing and other restructuring activities; accelerated amortization of deferred wage buydown assets; and settlement on research and development incentives also negatively impacted EBIT in North America by approximately $85 million and $40 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, EBIT was negatively impacted by: - electric vehicle development costs;
 - additional supplier insolvency costs;
 - increased commodity costs;
 - costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics capabilities;
 - higher warranty costs; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2008.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives (including reduced discretionary spending,
 employee reductions, reduced bonuses, and benefit plan changes)
 undertaken during or subsequent to 2008;
 - lower affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - no employee profit sharing for 2009;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities; and
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition from Plastech.
 Europe EBIT in Europe decreased $656 million to a loss of $415 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 December 31, 2009 compared to earnings of $241 million for the year ended December 31, 2008December 31, 2008. Excluding the European unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, the $566 million decrease in EBIT was substantially due to decreased margins earned on reduced sales as a result of significantly lower vehicle production volumes. ""Significant Items"" including, downsizing and other restructuring activities; accounts receivable valuation allowances; write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related to the cancelation of an assembly program; and costs related to the delay in the start of production in a program also negatively impacted EBIT in Europe by approximately $110 million and $5 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, EBIT was negatively impacted by: - costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches or for programs
 that have not fully ramped up production;
 - costs incurred at new facilities in Russia as we continue to pursue
 opportunities in this market;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities;
 - a favourable revaluation of warranty accruals during 2008;
 - costs incurred to develop and grow our electronics capabilities; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to 2008.
 These factors were partially offset by: - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence;
 - lower affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - the benefit of cost saving initiatives, including reduced
 discretionary spending, employee reductions, short work week
 schedules, reduced bonuses and voluntary wage reductions;
 - lower commodity costs; and
 - the sale of certain underperforming divisions during or subsequent to
 2008.
 Rest of World EBIT in Rest of World increased $11 million to $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 December 31, 2009 compared to $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of incremental margin earned on new programs that launched during or subsequent to 2008 in China partially offset by costs incurred at new facilities, substantially in India and Japan. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other EBIT decreased $118 million to a loss of $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 December 31, 2009 compared to earnings of $99 million for the year ended December 31, 2008December 31, 2008. Excluding the Corporate and Other unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, EBIT decreased by $2 million. ""Significant Items"" including, due diligence costs associated with our planned investment in Opel, which terminated during the fourth quarter of 2009; adjustments of our investment in ABCP; and other losses on disposal of assets also negatively impacted EBIT in Corporate and Other by approximately $25 million and $40 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, EBIT was negatively impacted by: - a decrease in affiliation fees earned from our divisions; and
 - a decrease in equity income earned.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the benefit of cost saving initiatives, including reduced
 discretionary spending, employee reductions, short work week
 schedules, reduced bonuses, voluntary wage reductions and benefit
 plan changes;
 - decreased executive compensation;
 - costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to electric
 vehicle development; and
 - lower charitable and social contributions.
 Interest Expense (Income), net During 2009, we recorded net interest expense of $7 million, compared to $62 million of net interest income for 2008. The $69 million decrease in net interest income is as a result of: - a decrease in interest income earned on lower cash and cash
 equivalent balances;
 - a decrease in interest income earned due to lower interest rates; and
 - an increase in interest expense paid on higher short-term borrowings.
 These factors were partially offset by a reduction in interest expense on long-term debt due to the repayment of our senior unsecured notes and 7.08% Subordinated Debentures. Operating Income (Loss) Operating income decreased $839 million to a loss of $511 million for 2009 compared to income of $328 million for 2008. Excluding the unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, operating income for 2009 decreased $899 million. The decrease in operating income is the result of the decreases in EBIT (including the approximately $145 million of additional ""Significant Items"" in 2009) and net interest income earned, both as discussed above. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate on operating income (excluding equity income) for 2009 and 2008 was significantly impacted by the unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section. Excluding unusual items, our effective income tax rate changed to a recovery of 6.7% for 2009 compared to an expense of 34.8% for 2008. The change in the effective income tax rate is primarily the result of an increase in losses not benefited primarily in Germany and Austria. Net Income (Loss) Net income decreased $564 million to a net loss of $493 million for 2009 compared to net income of $71 million for 2008. Excluding the unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income decreased $682 million. This decrease in net income is the result of the decrease in operating income partially offset by lower income taxes, both as discussed above. Earnings (Loss) per Share For the year

Excluding the unusual items, discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, diluted earnings per share decreased $6.04 from 2008 as a result of a decrease in net income (excluding unusual items) described above and a decrease in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during 2009. The decrease in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to the effect of the repurchase and cancelation of our Class A Subordinate Voting Shares in 2008 under the terms of our Normal Course Issuer Bid and a decrease in the number of diluted shares associated with restricted stock and stock options since such shares were anti-dilutive in 2009.

 Cash flow from operations before changes in non-cash operating assets and liabilities decreased $708 million to $621 million for 2009 compared to $1.3 billion for 2008. The decrease in cash flow from operations was primarily due to the $564 million decrease in net income, as discussed above, and a $223 million decrease in non-cash unusual items, $136 million reduction in depreciation and amortization offset in part by a $187 million increase in future taxes. Cash invested in non-cash operating assets and liabilities amounted to $94 million for 2009 compared to $275 million for 2008. The change in non-cash operating assets and liabilities is comprised of the following sources (and uses) of cash: For the year

 The increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable in 2009 was primarily due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. the $564 million decrease in net income relates to several tooling programs in North America and Europe and depletion of production inventory builds due to increased production volumes. The increase in income taxes receivable was primarily due to losses that are being carried back to prior years and higher refunds in North America. the $564 million decrease in net income is primarily a result of the payments during 2009 of restructuring costs that were accrued as at December 31, 2008.

 Fixed and other assets additions In 2009, we invested $629 million in fixed assets. While investments were made to refurbish or replace assets consumed in the normal course of business and for productivity improvements, a large portion of the investment in 2009 was for manufacturing equipment for programs that will be launching subsequent to 2009. In 2009, we invested $227 million in other assets related substantially to fully reimbursable planning and engineering and tooling costs at we complete vehicle engineering and assembly operations and we roof systems operations for programs that will be launching subsequent to 2009. Purchase of subsidiaries During 2009, we invested $50 million to purchase subsidiaries, including the acquisition of: - Cadence, a manufacturer of exterior and interior systems. The
 acquired business is primarily located in the Czech Republic with
 sales to various customers, including Skoda; and
 - several facilities from Meridian. - several facilities from Meridian are located in the
 United States and Mexico and manufacture composites for various
 customers.
 During 2008, we invested $158 million to purchase subsidiaries, including the acquisition of: - a facility from Ogihara America Corporation;
 - a substantial portion of the exteriors business and related assets
 from Plastech;
 - BluWav Systems LLC; and
 - Technoplast.
 Proceeds from disposition Proceeds from disposition in 2009 and 2008 were $30 million and $65 million, respectively, which represent normal course fixed and other asset disposals. Financing For the year

 In December 2008, in response to the uncertainty related to the financial viability of some of our key customers in North America, our drew down on our term and operating lines of credit. In February and March 2009, as the situation facing some of our key customers became clearer, our repaid $767 million of the outstanding lines of credit. The repayments of debt in 2009 consists primarily of the repayment of our 7.08% Subordinated Debentures in September 2009 and our 6.5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures in December 2009. During 2009, cash dividends of $21 million were paid on the Class A Subordinate Voting or Class B Shares in the first quarter of 2009. This compares to cash dividends of $140 million in 2008. During the second quarter of 2009, our Board of Directors suspended payment of dividends and, as a result, no cash dividends were paid on our Class A Subordinate Voting or Class B Shares for the remainder of 2009.

 Total capitalization decreased by $1.03 billion to $7.54 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to $8.57 billion at December 31, 2008. The decrease in capitalization was a result of a $1.03 billion decrease in liabilities. The decrease in capitalization is primarily as a result of a $767 million repayment on our outstanding lines of credit in the first quarter of 2009, the repayment of our during the third quarter of 2009 and the repayment of our during the fourth quarter of 2009. These decreases were partially offset by debt assumed on the acquisition of Cadence. The decrease in shareholders' equity was primarily as a result of: - the net loss incurred during 2009; and
 - dividends paid during the first quarter of 2009.
 These factors were partially offset by: - a $407 million increase in accumulated net unrealized gains on
 translation of our net investment in foreign operations, primarily
 as a result of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, euro and
 British pound, each against the U.S. dollar between December 31,
 2008 and December 31, 2009; and
 - net unrealized gains on cash flow hedges and the reclassification of
 net losses on cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive
 income to net loss.
 Cash Resources During 2009, our cash resources decreased by $1.4 billion to $1.3 billion primarily as a result of the net repayment of $0.9 billion on our outstanding lines of credit, cash used in investing activities, the repayment of our and the repayment of our 6.5% Convertible Subordinate Debentures, all as discussed previously. In addition to our cash resources, our had term and operating lines of credit totalling $2.1 billion. The unused and available portion of our lines of credit increased $0.9 billion to $1.9 billion during 2009 due to the net repayment on our operating lines. In addition, at December 31, 2009, our held Canadian third party ABCP with a face value of Cdn$134 million and a carrying value of Cdn$88 million, which was based on a valuation technique that estimates the fair value based on relevant current market indices for instruments of comparable credit quality, term and structure (""current market indices""). During 2009, we recorded a $9 million increase in the carrying value of we investment in ABCP due to a tightening of the spread between the anticipated return on the restructured notes and the current market indices.

 Our off balance sheet financing arrangements are limited to operating lease contracts. The majority of Our facilities are subject to operating leases with MID or with third parties. Operating lease payments in 2009 for facilities leased from MID and third parties were $149 million and $131 million, respectively. Operating lease commitments in 2010 for facilities leased from MID and third parties are expected to be $150 million and $128 million, respectively. Our existing leases with MID generally provide for periodic rent escalations based either on fixed-rate step increases, or on the basis of a consumer price index adjustment (subject to certain caps). Our also have operating lease commitments for equipment. Our existing leases with MID are generally of shorter duration. Operating lease payments for equipment were $42 million for 2009, and are expected to be $41 million in 2010. Although Our consolidated contractual annual lease commitments decline year by year, Our expect that existing leases will either be renewed or replaced, or alternatively, Our will incur capital expenditures to acquire equivalent capacity. Foreign Currency Activities Our North American operations negotiate sales contracts with OEMs for payment in both U.S. and Canadian dollars. Materials and equipment are purchased in various currencies depending upon competitive factors, including relative currency values. Our North American operations use labour and materials which are paid for in both U.S. and Canadian dollars. Our North American operations generally use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. Our negotiate sales contracts with OEMs for payment principally in euros and British pounds. Our North American operations material, equipment and labour are paid for principally in euros and British poundsBritish . Our employ hedging programs, primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts, in an effort to manage Our foreign exchange exposure, which arises when manufacturing facilities have committed to the delivery of products for which the selling price has been quoted in foreign currencies. These commitments represent Our contractual obligations to deliver products over the duration of the product programs, which can last a number of years. The amount and timing of the forward contracts will be dependent upon a number of factors, including anticipated production delivery schedules and anticipated production costs, which may be paid in the functional currency. In addition, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign exchange exposure with respect to internal funding arrangements. Despite these measures, significant long term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative values of the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, euro or British pound, could have an adverse effect on we profitability and financial condition (as discussed throughout this MD&A). RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- FINANCIAL RESULTS SUMMARY ------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the fourth quarter of 2009, we posted sales of $5.4 billion, an increase of 12% from the fourth quarter of 2008. This higher sales level was a result of increases in our North American, European and Rest of World production sales and complete vehicle assembly sales offset in part by a decrease in tooling, engineering and other sales. Comparing the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2008: - North American average dollar content per vehicle decreased 1%, while
 vehicle production increased 2%;
 - European average dollar content per vehicle increased 20%, and
 vehicle production increased 13%; and
 - Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 7% to $512 million from
 $479 million while complete vehicle assembly volumes declined 6%.
 During the fourth quarter of 2009, we generated an operating loss of $125 million compared to an operating loss of $165 million for 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, operating income increased by $80 million. Included in operating income for the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008 are several ""Significant Items"" that impact operating income representing approximately $130 million and $20 million, respectively. ""Significant Items"" consist primarily of: - downsizing and other restructuring activities that have not been
 included in the ""Unusual Items"" section;
 - an accounts receivable valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of
 2009;
 - due diligence costs associated with our planned investment in Opel,
 which terminated during the fourth quarter of 2009;
 - the write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related
 to the cancelation of an assembly program in the fourth quarter of
 2009;
 - costs related to the delay in the start of production of a program;
 and
 - other losses on disposal of assets.
 During the fourth quarter of 2009, net loss was $139 million compared to net loss of $148 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, net income for the fourth quarter 2009 increased $71 million. The increase in net income was a result of the increase in operating income partially offset by higher income taxes. During the fourth quarter of 2009, our diluted loss per share was $1.25 compared to diluted loss per share of $1.33 for the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the unusual items recorded in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, as discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, diluted loss per share for 2009 decreased $0.63. The decrease in diluted loss per share is primarily as a result of the increase in net income, excluding unusual items. For the three months

 External Production Sales - North America External production sales in North America increased 1% or $24 million to $2.42 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $2.39 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase in production sales reflects a 2% increase in North American vehicle production volumes partially offset by a 1% decrease in our North American average dollar content per vehicle. our North American average dollar content per vehicle declined by 1% or $6 to $868 for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $874 for the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of: - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or lower
 content on certain programs, including the:
 - GM full-sized pickups;
 - Chevrolet Cobalt;
 - GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave;
 - Chevrolet Impala;
 - Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and Volkswagen
 Routan;
 - Chevrolet HHR;
 - Mazda 6;
 - Dodge Ram; and
 - Chrysler 300 and 300C and Dodge Charger; and
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the fourth
 quarter of 2008, including the:
 - Pontiac G5, G6, Solstice, Sky and GT;
 - Chevrolet Trailblazer, GMC Envoy and Saab 9-7X; and
 - Saturn Vue, Aura and Outlook; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the fourth quarter of
 2008.
 These factors were partially offset by: - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the fourth quarter
 of 2008, including the:
 - Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Terrain, Pontiac Torrent and Suzuki XL7;
 - Cadillac SRX; and
 - Chevrolet Camaro;
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening
 of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar;
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or increased
 content on certain programs, including the:
 - Ford Escape, Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute; and
 - Ford F-Series and Lincoln Mark LT;
 - takeover business that launched subsequent to the fourth quarter
 of 2008; and
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to the fourth quarter
 of 2008, including several facilities from Meridian.
 External Production Sales - Europe External production sales in Europe increased 35% or $450 million to $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase in production sales reflects a 13% increase in European vehicle production volumes as discussed in the ""Highlights"" section combined with a 20% increase in our European average dollar content per vehicle. our average dollar content per vehicle grew by 20% or $87 to $523 for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $436 for the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily as a result of: - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening of
 the euro and British pound, each against the U.S. dollar;
 - acquisitions completed during or subsequent to the fourth quarter of
 2008, including Cadence; and
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the fourth quarter
 of 2008, including the:
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Skoda Yeti;
 - MINI Cooper Convertible; and
 - Audi A5 Cabrio and Sportback;
 - favourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or increased
 content on certain programs, including the Audi Q5.
 These factors were partially offset by: - unfavourable production (relative to industry volumes) and/or lower
 content on certain programs, including the:
 - Volkswagen Transporter;
 - Smart fortwo;
 - Mercedes-Benz C-Class;
 - BMW X3;
 - Mercedes-Benz B-Class and B-Class Fuel Cell; and
 - Volkswagen Tiguan;
 - programs that ended production during or subsequent to the fourth
 quarter of 2008, including the GAZ Siber; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the fourth quarter of
 2008.
 External Production Sales - Rest of World External production sales in Rest of World increased 115% or $118 million to $221 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $103 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of: - increased production and/or content on certain programs in China,
 Korea and Brazil;
 - the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the fourth quarter
 of 2008 in China and Japan; and
 - an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales as a result of the
 weakening of the Brazilian real and Korean won, each against the
 U.S. dollar.

 Complete vehicle assembly sales increased 7% or $33 million to $512 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $479 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 and assembly volumes decreased 6% or 1,081 units. The higher sales level is primarily as a result of an increase in reported U.S. dollar sales due to the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar partially offset by the decrease in complete vehicle assembly volumes due to the natural decline in volumes as certain models that we currently assemble approach their scheduled end of production. However, the Peugeot RCZ launched in the fourth quarter of 2009 and several new complete vehicle assembly programs have been awarded and are scheduled to launch throughout 2010 to 2013. Tooling, Engineering and Other Tooling, engineering and other sales decreased 7% or $42 million to $547 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $589 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the major programs for which we recorded tooling, engineering and other sales were the: - Audi Q5;
 - Porsche Panamera;
 - Porsche Boxster and Cayman;
 - Mercedes-Benz M-Class;
 - Porsche Cayenne;
 - Peugeot RCZ;
 - MINI Cooper, Clubman and Crossman;
 - Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra;

 North America EBIT in North America increased $175 million to $84 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to a loss of $91 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the North American unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, EBIT increased $121 million. ""Significant Items"" including, downsizing and other restructuring activities also negatively impacted EBIT in North America by approximately $25 million and $15 million in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - the benefit of restructuring and downsizing activities and cost
 saving initiatives (including reduced discretionary spending,
 employee reductions, reduced bonuses, and benefit plan changes)
 undertaken during or subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2008;
 - roductivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - lower affiliation fees paid to corporate;
 - no employee profit sharing for the fourth quarter of 2009;
 - lower commodity costs; and
 - incremental margin earned from acquisitions completed subsequent to
 the fourth quarter of 2008.
 These factors were partially offset by: - higher warranty costs;
 - electric vehicle development costs;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the fourth quarter of
 2008.
 Europe EBIT in Europe decreased $127 million to a loss of $202 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to a loss of $75 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the European unusual items discussed in the ""Unusual Items"" section, EBIT decreased by $33 million. ""Significant Items"" including, downsizing and other restructuring activities; accounts receivable valuation allowances; write-off of uncollectable pre-production costs incurred related to the cancelation of an assembly program; and costs related to the delay in the start of production in a program also negatively impacted EBIT in Europe by approximately $70 million and $5 million in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - lower commodity costs;
 - incremental margin earned related to the acquisition of Cadence
 during the second quarter of 2009;
 - productivity and efficiency improvements at certain facilities;
 - lower incentive compensation; and
 - the benefit of cost saving initiatives, including reduced
 discretionary spending, employee reductions, short work week
 schedules, reduced bonuses, and voluntary wage reductions.
 These factors were partially offset by: - costs incurred at new facilities in Russia as we continue to pursue
 opportunities in this market;
 - costs incurred to develop and grow we electronics capabilities;
 - costs incurred in preparation for upcoming launches or for programs
 that have not fully ramped up production;
 - operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain facilities;
 - higher warranty costs; and
 - net customer price concessions subsequent to the fourth quarter of
 2008.
 Rest of World Rest of World EBIT increased $15 million to $18 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $3 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of incremental margin earned on new programs that launched during or subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2008 in China partially offset by costs incurred at new facilities, primarily in Japan. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other EBIT decreased $10 million to a loss of $26 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to a loss of $16 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. ""Significant Items"" including, due diligence costs associated with our planned investment in Opel, which terminated during the fourth quarter of 2009; and other losses on disposal also negatively impacted EBIT in Corporate and Other by approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. In addition, EBIT was positively impacted by: - costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to electric
 vehicle development;
 - an increase in equity income earned; and
 - the benefit of cost saving initiatives, including reduced
 discretionary spending, employee reductions, voluntary wage
 reductions and benefit plan changes.
 These factors were partially offset by a decrease in affiliation fees earned from our divisions. FUTURE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Conversion to International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") in Fiscal 2011 In February 2008, the Canadian Accounting Standards Board confirmed the transition from Canadian GAAP to IFRS for all publicly accountable entities no later than fiscal years commencing on or after January 1, 2011. As a result, throughout 2009, we undertook a detailed review of the implications of having to report under IFRS and also examined the alternative available to we, as a Foreign Private Issuer in the United States, of filing we primary financial statements in Canada using U.S. GAAP, as permitted by the Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 51-102, ""Continuous Disclosure Obligations"". In carrying out this evaluation, we considered many factors, including, but not limited to (i) the changes in accounting policies that would be required and the resulting impact on we reported results and key performance indicators, (ii) the reporting standards expected to be used by many of our industry comparables, and (iii) the financial reporting needs of our market participants, including shareholders, lenders, rating agencies and market analysts. As a result of this analysis, we have determined that we will adopt U.S. GAAP as we primary basis of financial reporting with we first reporting period beginning after January 1, 2011. we have already commenced planning and implementation of this transition and the adoption of U.S. GAAP is not anticipated to have a material change on we accounting policies or financial results, except for the reporting differences disclosed in note 26 of we 2008 consolidated financial statements. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- From time to time, we may be contingently liable for litigation and other claims. Refer to note 24 of we 2008 audited consolidated financial statements, which describes these claims. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ------------------------------------------------------------------------- There have been no changes in we internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, we internal control over financial reporting.

 See accompanying notes MAGNA INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Unaudited)(All amounts in U.S. dollars and all tabular amounts in millions unlessotherwise noted) ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Magna International Inc. and Magna International Inc. subsidiaries (collectively ""Magna"" or the ""Company"") have been prepared in United States dollars following Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") with respect to the preparation of interim financial information. Accordingly, The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Magna International Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively ""Magna"" or the ""Company"") do not include all the information and footnotes required in the preparation of annual financial statements and therefore should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2008 audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's 2008 Annual Report.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------- (a) North America For the year ended December 31, 2009 In conjunction with its annual business planning cycle, during the fourth quarter of 2009 the Company determined that the Company Car Top Systems (""CTS"") North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired, primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic reduction in the market for soft tops, hard tops and modular retractable hard tops; and (ii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout the Company's business planning period. Based on North America reporting unit's discounted forecast cashflows, the Company recorded a $25 million goodwill impairment charge. In addition, during the second quarter of 2009, after failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain facility in Syracuse, New York, the Company the Company decided to wind down failing to reach a favourable labour agreement at a powertrain facility in Syracuse, New York. Given the significance of the facility's cashflows in relation to North America reporting unit, management determined that it was more likely than not that goodwill at North America reporting unit could potentially be impaired. Therefore, the Company recorded a $75 million goodwill impairment charge. The goodwill impairment charges were calculated by determining the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the Company had acquired the Powertrain and CTS reporting units as at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $13 million ($11 million after tax) related to fixed assets at a die casting facility in Canada and an anticipated under recovery of capitalized tooling costs at a stamping facility in United States due to significantly lower volumes on certain SUV programs. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company recorded restructuring costs of $6 million in cost of goods sold ($6 million after tax) related to the planned closure of a powertrain facility in Syracuse, New York, substantially all of which will be paid subsequent to 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2008 During 2008, the Company recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $275 million ($238 million after tax), related primarily to the Company powertrain and interior and exterior systems operations in United States and Canada. At the Company's powertrain operations, particularly at a facility in Syracuse, New York, asset impairment charges of $189 million ($169 million after tax) were recorded primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic market shift away from truck programs, in particular four wheel drive pick-up trucks and SUVs; (iii) excess die-casting, machining and assembly capacity; and (iii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout the Company's business planning period. At its interiors and exteriors operations, the Company recorded $74 million ($61 million after tax) of asset impairment charges primarily as a result of: (i) significantly lower volumes on certain pick-up truck and SUV programs; (ii) the loss of certain replacement business; and (iii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout the Company's business planning period. During 2008, the Company the Company recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $79 million in cost of goods sold and $5 million in selling, general and administrative expense ($60 million after tax) related to the above long-lived asset impairments and other restructuring activities. Substantially all of the $84 million was paid during 2009. (b) Europe For the year ended December 31, 2009 During 2009, the Company recorded long-lived assets impairment charges of $70 million ($70 million after tax) related to the Company CTS and exterior systems operations in Germany. At the Company's powertrain operations, long-lived asset impairment charges of $59 million ($59 million after tax) were recorded related to fixed and intangible assets. The impairment charge was calculated based on CTS discounted forecast cashflows and was necessary primarily as a result of: (i) a dramatic reduction in the market for soft tops, hard tops and modular retractable hard tops; and (ii) historical losses that are projected to continue throughout the Company's business planning period. At Company , the Company recorded an $11 million ($11 million after tax) asset impairment charge related to specific under-utilized assets in Germany. During 2009, the Company the Company recorded restructuring and rationalization costs of $17 million in cost of goods sold and $3 million in selling, general and administrative expense ($20 million after tax). The goodwill impairment charges consist primarily of severance and other termination benefits related to the closure of powertrain and interior systems facilities in Germany. Substantially all of the $20 million will be paid subsequent to 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2008 During 2008, the Company recorded an $8 million ($8 million after tax) asset impairment related to the disposal of specific assets at an interior systems facility in United States and specific assets at a powertrain facility in Austria. 3.

The acquired business is primarily located in the Czech Republic with sales to various customers, including Skoda. On June 1, 2009, Magna acquired several facilities from Meridian Automotive Systems Inc. The facilities located in United States and Mexico manufacture composites for various customers. The total consideration for these acquisitions and certain other acquisitions was $136 million, consisting of $50 million paid in cash and $86 million of assumed debt. The purchase price allocations for these acquisitions and certain other acquisitions are preliminary and adjustments to The purchase price allocations for these acquisitions may occur as a result of obtaining more information regarding asset valuations. On a preliminary basis, an allocation of the excess purchase price over the book value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been made to goodwill and intangible assets. 5. INVESTMENTS At December 31, 2009, the Company held Canadian third party asset- backed commercial paper (""ABCP"") with a face value of Cdn$134 million and a carrying value of Cdn$88 million (December 31, 2008 - Cdn$79 million), which was based on a valuation technique that estimates the fair value based on relevant current market indices for instruments of comparable credit quality, term and structure (""current market indices""). During the third quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a $9 million increase in the carrying value of the Company's investment in ABCP in selling, general and administrative expense, due to a tightening of the spread between the anticipated return on the restructured notes and the current market indices. During 2008, the Company recorded a $41 million impairment charge (Q3 - $24 million; Q1 - $17 million) in selling, general and administrative expense. a $41 million impairment charge (Q3 - $24 million; Q1 - $17 million) in selling, general and administrative expense was calculated based on the anticipated return on the restructured notes (the ""Notes"") versus the spreads using current market indices and a charge against potentially non-performing assets calculated on a probability weighted basis. Refer to note 8 of the Company's 2008 audited consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the significant estimates and assumptions incorporated into the valuation of our ABCP. 6.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------- (b) Fair value the Company determined the estimated fair values of the Company financial instruments based on valuation methodologies the Company believes are appropriate; however, considerable judgment is required to develop the estimated fair values of its financial instruments based on valuation methodologies it believes are appropriate. Accordingly, these estimated fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange can be materially affected by the use of different assumptions or methodologies. The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments are described below: Cash and cash equivalents, bank indebtedness, accounts payable, accrued salaries and wages, other accrued liabilities and income taxes receivable. Due to the short period to maturity of the instruments, the carrying values as presented in the consolidated balance sheets are reasonable estimates of fair values. Investments At December 31, 2009, the Company held Canadian third party asset-backed commercial paper (""ABCP"") with a face value of Cdn$134 million. The carrying value and estimated fair value of this investment was Cdn$88 million (December 31, 2008 - Cdn$79 million). As fair value information is not readily determinable for the Company's investment in ABCP, the fair value was based on a valuation technique estimating the fair value from the perspective of a market participant. In addition, fair value information is not readily available for the Company's investment in equity accounted investees. However, management believes the market value to be in excess of the carrying value of these investments. Term debt Term debt includes $16 million due within one year. Due to the short period to maturity of Term debt, the carrying value as presented in the consolidated balance sheet is a reasonable estimate of the Company fair value. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt, based on the current rates for debt with similar terms and maturities, is not materially different from the Company carrying value. (c) Credit risk the Company's financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, held to maturity investments, and foreign exchange forward contracts with positive fair values. The Company's held for trading investments include an investment in ABCP. Given the continuing uncertainties regarding the value of the underlying assets, the amount and timing over cash flows and the risk of collateral calls in the event that spreads widened considerably, the Company could be exposed to further losses on the Company investment. Cash and cash equivalents, which consists of short-term investments, are only invested in governments, bank term deposits and bank commercial paper with an investment grade credit rating. Credit risk is further reduced by limiting the amount which is invested in certain governments or any major financial institution. the Company is also exposed to credit risk from the potential default by any of the Company counterparties on the Company foreign exchange forward contracts. the Company the Company mitigates this credit risk by dealing with counterparties who are major financial institutions that the Company the Company anticipates will satisfy counterparties who are major financial institutions that the Company anticipates obligations under the contracts. In the normal course of business, the Company the Company is exposed to credit risk from the Company customers, substantially all of which are in the automotive industry and are subject to credit risks associated with the automotive industry. Sales to the Company's three largest customers, General Motors, BMW and Ford for the three months and year ended December 31, 2009 represented 47% and 49% of the Company's total sales, respectively. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2009, sales to the Company's six largest customers (including the Detroit 3) represented 81% and 82% of the Company's total sales, respectively, and substantially all of Company sales are to customers in which the Company has ongoing contractual relationships. (d) Currency risk the Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates when manufacturing facilities have committed to the delivery of products for which the selling price has been quoted in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency, or when materials and equipment are purchased in currencies other than the facilities' functional currency. In an effort to manage this net foreign exchange exposure, the Company the Company employs hedging programs, primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. As at December 31, 2009, the net foreign exchange exposure was not material. (e) Interest rate risk the Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk due to the short-term maturity of the Company monetary current assets and current liabilities. In particular, the amount of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents is impacted more by the investment decisions made and the demands to have available cash on hand, than by movements in the interest rates over a given period. In addition, the Company is not exposed to interest rate risk on the Company term debt instruments as the interest rates on these instruments are fixed."
